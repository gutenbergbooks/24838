    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      A small, squat and dirty-looking trading steamer, with the name <i>Motutapu</i>
      painted in yellow letters on her bows and stern, lay at anchor off the
      native village of Utiroa on Drummond's Island in the Equatorial Pacific.
      She was about 800 tons burden, and her stained and rusty sides made her
      appear as if she had been out of port for two years instead of scarcely
      four months.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this present moment four of her five boats were alongside, each one
      piled high over the gunwales with bags of copra, which the steam winch was
      hoisting in as quickly as possible, for night was drawing on and Captain
      Louis Hendry, who was then ashore, had given orders to the mate, a burly
      Yorkshireman named Oliver, to be ready to heave up at six o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had been intensely hot and windless, the sea lay sweltering,
      leaden-hued and misty, and the smoke from the native houses in Utiroa
      village hung low down amid the groves of coco-palms which encompassed it
      on three sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the after-deck of the steamer, under the awning, a man was lying on a
      bed of mats, with a water-bottle and a plate of bananas beside him. Seated
      cross-legged beside him was a native boy, about fifteen years of age, who
      kept fanning his master's face, and driving away the pestering flies. It
      was easy to see that the man was suffering from fever. His deeply-bronzed
      cheeks had yellowed and were thin and hollow, and his eyes dull and
      apathetic. He looked like a man of fifty, though he was in reality not
      more than thirty-two. Every now and then he drank, then lay back again
      with a groan of pain. Piled up on the skylight was a heap of rugs and
      blankets, for use when the violent chilling attack of ague would follow on
      the burning, bone-racking heat of fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the mate, accompanied by the chief engineer, came aft. Both men
      were very hot and very dirty, and their faces were streaming with
      perspiration. They sat down on deck-chairs beside the sick man, called to
      the steward for a bottle of beer, and asked him how he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carr made a sudden effort and sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;&mdash; bad, Oliver! I have about six hundred and forty-nine
      pains all over me, and no two of them in the same place. I've swilled
      enough water to float a battleship; and, look here! you must give me some
      beer: a bottle&mdash;two bottles&mdash;a gallon&mdash;a cask! Beer I will
      have if I perish like a beast in the field. I can't drink water like
      that-it's as hot as &mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morrison, the Scotch engineer, smiled. &ldquo;Don't swear, Carr. Ye shall have
      just one long drink of beer. 'Twill do ye no great harm on such a roasting
      day as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward brought two bottles of lager beer, and Carr eagerly extended
      his thin, brown hand for the creamy, tempting liquid poured out for him by
      the mate. He drank it off and then laid down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are we getting out of this beastly hole, Oliver?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To night, I expect-that is, if the skipper comes aboard fairly sober. He
      doesn't often get too much grog aboard, but this island is one of the
      places where he is bound to get loaded up. The two traders ashore are
      countrymen of his, I believe, though they call themselves Britishers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carr nodded. &ldquo;Dutchmen of some kind, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, like himself. He's a Dane, though if you told him so he'd get nasty
      over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a nasty brute, anyway,&rdquo; said Carr wearily. &ldquo;I don't like that shifty
      eye of his. And I think he's a bit of a sneak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't <i>think</i> it; you can be sure of it. I'll prove it to you
      in a minute,&rdquo; said the mate. &ldquo;Both he and that fat beast of a supercargo
      are a pair of sneaks, and they hate you like poison. What have you done to
      offend them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that I know of. But I have always suspected that neither of them
      are too fond of me. Hendry I consider a low-lived scoundrel. I met his
      wife and daughters in Sydney a year ago&mdash;went to his house with him.
      They think he's a perfect saint, and at the time I thought so too,
      considering he's been in the island trade for ten years. But I know what
      he is pretty well by now. He's not fit to be married to a decent white
      woman and have children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate assented. &ldquo;You're right, Carr. He's a double-faced swab, and a
      thundering hypocrite as well. There's only one good point about him&mdash;he's
      a rattling good sailor man. As for Sam Chard, he's simply a drunken bully.
      I shall be glad to be quit of this hooker. I'm not a paragon of virtue,
      but this ship is a bit too rocky for me. Now I will show you what I meant
      just now when I said I'll prove that both Hendry and Chard are sneaks, and
      have their knives into you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared below for a few seconds, and then returned carrying a
      letter-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Carr, my boy,&rdquo; he said, seating himself beside the sick trader
      again, &ldquo;just cock your ears and listen. This is our esteemed supercargo's
      letter-book. I had to go into his cabin yesterday to look for the list of
      ship's stores, and I saw this letter-book lying on his table, opened at
      this particular page. I caught your name, and took the liberty of reading
      the letter. It is addressed to the owners in Sydney, and is dated May 5,
      1889.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was two days after you and the skipper and Chard had the row about
      those flash Samoan girls coming aboard at Vavau,&rdquo; put in Morrison, &ldquo;and he
      and Chard started to knock the hands about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Carr, as a grim smile flitted across his yellow face;
      &ldquo;go on, Oliver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate began:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'SS. <i>Motutapu</i>. Niafu Harbour,
     &ldquo;'Vavau, Tonga Islands,
     &ldquo;'May 5, 1889.

     &ldquo;'Dear Sirs,&mdash;As the barque <i>Metaris</i> leaves to-day for
     Sydney, I take the opportunity of writing you to report
     progress of cruise of the <i>Motutapu</i> up to date.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then followed an account of the various trading operations in which the
      steamer had been engaged from the time she left Sydney up to her arrival
      at the Friendly Islands. Then&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'In pursuance of your instructions, we called at Kabaira
     Bay, New Britain, to remove Mr. Harvey Carr from there to a
     more healthy location. We found Mr. Carr's station in a
     satisfactory state, and his accounts were correct.    But
     both Captain Hendry and myself are of the opinion that Mr.
     Carr was on altogether too friendly terms with the manager
     of the German firm at Blanche Bay, and we believe that your
     firm's interest has greatly suffered thereby. He certainly
     was ill, but we do not think his illness has been caused by
     fever, of which we could see no traces, but by his availing
     himself of the too lavish hospitality of the manager of the
     German firm. He had also, I learnt, become very thick with
     the Wesleyan missionaries at Port Hunter, and seems to have
     been continually visiting them under the pretext of getting
     medical attendance from the Rev. Dr. Bowen, who, as you are
     well aware, is a determined opponent of your firm in New
     Britain, and has made several adverse reports upon our
     manner of trading with the natives to the commander of H.M.
     ships.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; inquired the engineer wrathfully, striking
      his clenched hand upon his knee; &ldquo;and the fellow is a Scotsman, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carr laughed. &ldquo;Don't get angry, Morrison. He's one of the wrong sort of
      Scotsmen. Give me some beer. I'm a drunken beast, aren't I? Go on,
      Oliver.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'In fact Mr. Carr seems to have thoroughly ingratiated
     himself with the missionaries as well as with the Germans,
     and I think it is my duty to mention this to you at the
     earliest opportunity. I proposed to him that he should take
     charge of one of your stations in the New Hebrides, but he
     declined to remain in Melanesia, alleging that he is
     suffering from fever, and insisting on being given a station
     in the Caroline Islands. I pointed out to him that it would
     be to the firm's advantage for him to remain in the vicinity
     of New Britain, whereupon he was grossly insulting, and said
     that the firm could go to hell, that he studied his own
     health as much as anything. Furthermore, he made the direct
     statement that he was not anxious to continue in the service
     of a firm that resorted to shady and illegal practices, such
     as sly grog-selling, and other blackguardly things. These
     words he uttered to myself and Captain Hendry. On Sunday
     last, the 3rd inst., myself and the captain had occasion to
     exercise our authority over our native crew, who were making
     a noise on deck. Mr. Carr&mdash;who was violently excited from
     the effects of liquor&mdash;at once interfered and took the part
     of the crew, who not only threatened both myself and Captain
     Hendry with personal violence, but committed an assault on
     us. I consider that the firm will be wise to terminate their
     connection with Mr. Carr. His presence on board is a
     continual source of trouble, and I shall be glad to have
     authority from you to dismiss him. Captain Hendry bears me
     out in these statements, and herewith attaches his signature
     to mine.

     &ldquo;'I am, dear Sir,

     &ldquo;'Yours very obediently,

     &ldquo;'Samuel Chard, supercargo.

     &ldquo;'Louis Hendry, master. &ldquo;'Messrs. Hillingdon &amp; McFreeland,
     &ldquo;'Sydney.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that, Carr?&rdquo; &ldquo;It doesn't astonish me, Oliver, for
      Chard, with all his seeming <i>bonhomie</i>, is as big a black-guard as
      Hendry. And there is a certain amount of truth in his letter&mdash;I did
      say that the firm of Hillingdon and McFreeland were guilty of shady and
      illegal practices, and that the High Commissioner in Fiji would bring them
      up with a round turn some day. But, as you know, all the rest is false&mdash;downright
      lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate slapped him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Lies! Of course they are! Now just
      listen to what I have written in my own private log.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped along to the deck-house, entered his cabin, and came back with
      the private log aforesaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, listen to this:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'Vavau, Tonga Islands, May 3, 1889.&mdash;This evening Captain
     Hendry and Mr. Chard, the supercargo, came on board at six
     o'clock, accompanied by several white men and a number of
     loose Samoan women. They were all more or less under the
     influence of drink. As is usual, our native crew were seated
     on the fore-hatch, holding their evening service, when Mr.
     Chard went for'ard, and with considerable foul language
     desired them to stop their damned psalm-singing. He then
     offered them two bottles of Hollands gin. The native seamen
     refused to accept the liquor, whereupon Mr. Chard struck one
     of them and knocked him down. Then Captain Hendry, who was
     much the worse for drink, came for'ard, and calling on me to
     follow and assist him, attacked the crew, who were very-
     excited (but offered no violence), with an iron belaying-
     pin. He stunned three of them before the second mate, the
     chief engineer, and myself could restrain him, and he
     threatened to shoot what he called &ldquo;the ringleaders of a
     mutiny.&rdquo; He had a revolver belted round his waist. The
     native crew then came aft and made a complaint to. Mr.
     Harvey Carr, the trader, who was lying ill with fever in his
     berth. He came on deck, and speaking in Samoan to the crew
     and to the women who had been brought on board by Captain
     Hendry and the supercargo, urged the women to go on shore,
     as it was Sunday. This they at once did, and getting into a
     canoe, paddled away. Thereupon Captain Hendry, Mr. Sam
     Chard, and the white traders became very insulting to Mr.
     Carr, who, although he was so ill, kept his temper, until
     Mr. Chard called him a &ldquo;missionary crawler.&rdquo; This
     expression made Mr. Carr lose control of himself, and he
     used very strong language to Captain Hendry and the
     supercargo upon the gross impropriety of their conduct. He
     certainly used expressions that he should not have employed,
     but under the circumstances, and bearing in mind the fact
     that the native crew were ready for mutiny, and that mutiny
     was only averted by Mr. Carr's influence over the native
     crew, I and my fellow officers, whose names are attached,
     desire to record the facts of the case.

     &ldquo;'Then Captain Hendry and Mr. Sam Chard used very foul
     language to Mr. Carr, who again lost his temper and called
     the former a damned stock-fish eating Dutchman, who had no
     right to sail under British colours as an Englishman, and
     ought to be kicked off the deck of a British ship.    He
     (Mr. Carr) then, being greatly excited, added that Captain
     Hendry, being a married man with a large family, was little
     better than a brute beast in his mode of life, else he would
     not have brought half a dozen native harlots on board&mdash;women
     whose very presence insulted even his native crew. Mr. Chard
     then advanced towards Mr. Carr in a threatening manner,
     whereupon the whole native crew, headed by a white stoker
     named Cleaver, rushed the after-deck, seized Captain Hendry
     and Mr. Chard, and threw them below into the saloon.

     &ldquo;'Mr. Carr then addressed the crew in their own several
     languages, and explained to them the danger of laying hands
     upon the captain or an officer of the ship; also he
     explained to them his own position as a passenger. They
     listened to him quietly, and promised to follow his
     directions. At six o'clock Captain Hendry and Mr. Sam Chard
     came on deck, and in my presence and in that of the second
     officer and Felix Latour, the steward, apologised to Mr.
     Carr. Mr. Carr, who was very exhausted with fever, shook
     hands with them both, and the matter has ended. I have
     briefly entered these occurrences in the ship's log, which
     Captain Hendry refuses to sign. But this statement of mine
     is signed as follows:&mdash;

     &ldquo;'James Oliver, Chief Officer.

     &ldquo;'Jos. Atkins, Second Officer.

     &ldquo;'Felix Latour, Steward.

     &ldquo;'Tom Cleaver, Fireman.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The trader held out his hand, &ldquo;Thank you, Oliver. But I'm afraid that the
      firm of Hillingdon and McFreeland will be glad to get rid of a man like
      me. I'm not the sort of trader they want. I took service with them under
      the impression that they were straight people. They are not&mdash;they are
      simply unmitigated sweeps. Hillingdon, with his solemn, stone-jug-like
      face, I <i>know</i> to be a most infernal rogue. He fakes the firm's
      accounts to the detriment of the London people who are paying the piper,
      and who are really the firm. As for Sam Chard and this measly, sneaking,
      Danish skipper, they are merely minor thieves. But I didn't do so badly
      with them, did I, Oliver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate laughed loudly. &ldquo;No, indeed. You settled them that time. But you
      must be careful. Hendry especially is a dangerous man. I believe that he
      wouldn't stick at murder if it could be done without any fear of
      detection. And he hates you like poison. Chard, too, is a scoundrel, but
      wouldn't do anything worse than he has done, which is bad enough, for the
      fat blackguard always keeps up the appearance of a jolly, good-natured
      fellow. But be careful of Hendry. Don't lean on the rail on a dark night
      when he's on deck. He'd give you a hoist overboard in a second if you gave
      him a chance and no one was about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll watch him, Oliver. And when I get better, I'll take it out of him.
      But I'm not going to let him and Chard drive me out of the ship. I am
      under a two years' engagement to this rascally firm, and have only three
      more months to put in. I'll settle in the Carolines, and start trading
      there on my own account. I'm sick of this filthy old tub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So is Morrison, and so am I,&rdquo; said the mate, as he rose to go for'ard
      again. &ldquo;Hallo, here is the skipper coming at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later the captain's boat, came alongside, and Hendry
      and his supercargo came aft under the awning, and with much solicitude
      asked Carr how he was feeling. He replied civilly to their inquiries, but
      excused himself when Chard asked him to have a small bottle of lager. They
      were accompanied by two respectable-looking white men, who were resident
      traders on Drummond's Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some news for you, Mr. Carr,&rdquo; said the supercargo genially;
      &ldquo;there's an old friend of yours here, a trader named Remington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carr raised himself with an expression of pleasure lighting up in his
      worn, thin face. &ldquo;Old Jack Remington! Where is he? I <i>shall</i> be glad
      to see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll be aboard here in another hour. He has a station at the north end
      of the island. The moment we mentioned your name he said he would come and
      see you. His daughter is going on to the Carolines with us, and he has
      just now gone off to his station to bring her on board, as the captain
      wants to get away at daylight in the morning.&rdquo; Then with a pleasant nod he
      moved his chair some little distance away, and began talking business with
      the two traders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carr, lying on his side with half-closed eyes, apparently was trying to
      sleep, in reality he was studying the supercargo's face. It was a
      handsome, &ldquo;taking&rdquo; sort of face, rather full and a bit coarse perhaps,
      deeply browned by tropic suns, and lit up by a pair of jet black eyes,
      which, when the possessor was in a good temper and laughed, seemed to
      dance in unison. Yet they were eyes that in a moment could narrow and show
      an ugly gleam, that boded ill for the object of their owner's resentment.
      His curly hair and beard were jet black also, save here and there where
      they were streaked with grey, and his figure, stout, but close and
      well-knit together, showed him to be a man of great strength and activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the face of the supercargo Carr let his glance light upon the figure
      of Captain Louis Hendry, who was standing at the break of the poop talking
      to the chief mate. He was a small, slightly-built man of about fifty years
      of age, with regular features, and wore a flowing grey beard trimmed to a
      point. His eyes were those of the true Scandinavian, a bright steely blue,
      though at the present moment the whites were bloodshot and angry-looking.
      As he talked he kept stroking his beard, and directing sullen glances at
      the crew, who were still working hard at hoisting in the bags of copra. It
      was not a pleasant face to look at&mdash;a sullen ill-humour seemed to
      glower forth from under the bushy grey eyebrows, and vie with a nervous,
      sneaking apprehensiveness, as if he every moment feared to be struck from
      behind. That he was a bit of a dandy was very evident, for although his
      navy serge coat and cap were soiled and dirty, they were both heavily
      trimmed with gold lace&mdash;a most unusual adornment for the master of an
      island trading steamer. Like his supercargo, he carried a revolver at his
      side, and at this Carr looked with a contemptuous smile, for neither of
      the two traders, who actually lived on the island, thought it necessary to
      carry arms, though the natives of Taputeauea, as Drummond's Island was
      called, had a bad reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after sunset, and whilst supper was proceeding in the saloon, a
      smart whaleboat, manned by a crew of half-naked natives of Pleasant
      Island, came alongside, and an old white-haired man of past sixty stepped
      on deck. He was accompanied by a fair-skinned, dark-haired girl of about
      twenty. The boatswain conducted them aft to where Carr, now shaking with a
      violent attack of ague, was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; cried the old man, kneeling beside the trader, and looking
      into his face with intense sympathy. &ldquo;I am so glad to meet you again,
      though sorry to see you so ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carr, with chattering teeth, held out an icy-cold hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Remington? And you, Tessa? I'll be all right in another ten
      minutes, and then we can talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tessa Remington slipped down on the deck into a sitting posture beside
      him, and placed her soft, warm hand on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk any more just now, Mr. Carr. There, let me tuck you in
      properly,&rdquo; and she wrapped the rugs more closely around him. &ldquo;I know
      exactly what to do, don't I, father?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      From his boyhood Harvey Carr had been a wanderer among the islands of the
      Southern Seas. Before he was sixteen his father, who was owner and master
      of a Hobart Town whaleship, had perished at sea in one of the ship's boats
      after the loss of his vessel upon an uncharted reef in the South Pacific.
      And though another sixteen years had almost passed since that dreadful
      time of agony and hunger, and thirst and madness, when men looked at each
      other with a horrid meaning in their wolfish eyes, the boy had never
      forgotten his dying father's words, spoken to the lad when the grey shadow
      of the end had deepened upon the old seaman's rugged face&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm done for, Harvey. Try to keep up the men's courage. Rain will fall
      before morning. I know it is coming, though I shall never feel it. Stick
      to your two little sisters, boy; you must be their mainstay when I am
      gone. Lead a clean life, Harvey. You can do it if you think of your dead
      mother and of me.... And tell the men to stick steady to an east-southeast
      course. They'll feel fresh and strong when the rain comes. Drop me over
      the side the moment I'm gone, lad, won't you? Don't let any one of them
      touch me. Goodbye, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those awful days of horror had helped to strengthen Harvey Carr's natural
      resolution and steadfastness of purpose in life. When the famished and
      hideous-looking survivors of the crew of the <i>City of Hope</i> were
      picked up two days later the orphaned sailor lad made a vow to devote
      himself to his sisters and &ldquo;live clean.&rdquo; And he had kept his vow, though
      for many years he had lived as trader, mate, or supercargo, among people
      and in places where loose living was customary with white men, and where
      any departure from the general practice was looked upon with either
      contemptuous pity or open scorn. Yet no one, not even the roughest and
      most dissolute beachcomber in the two Pacifics, would have dared to
      &ldquo;chaff&rdquo; Harvey Carr upon his eccentricity, for he had an unpleasant manner
      when aroused which meant danger to the man who was so wanting in judgment.
      Yet some men <i>had</i> &ldquo;chaffed&rdquo; him, and found out to their cost that
      they had picked upon the wrong sort of man; for if he was slow with his
      tongue he was quick with his hands, and knew how to use them in a manner
      which had given intense pleasure to numerous gentry who, in South Sea
      ports, delight to witness a &ldquo;mill&rdquo; in default of being able to take part
      in it themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the years had slipped by with Harvey Carr, wandering from one
      island to another either as trader or seaman. Of such money as he made he
      sent the greater portion to his sisters in the Colonies, retaining only
      enough for himself to enable him to live decently. He was not an ascetic,
      he drank fairly with his rough companions, gambled occasionally in a
      moderate manner with them, swore when the exigences of seafaring life
      demanded it, but no one had ever heard his name coupled with that of a
      woman, white or brown, though he was essentially a favourite with the
      latter; for at the end of fifteen years' experience in the South Seas,
      from Easter Island to the far Bonins, he was one of the few white men who
      thoroughly understood the character and disposition of the various peoples
      among whom he had lived. Had he been a man of education his knowledge of
      native languages, thought and mode of life generally, might have brought
      him some money, fame, and distinction in the world beyond, but he took no
      thought of such things; for to him the world beyond was an unknown
      quantity, only associated in his mind with his sisters, who had sometimes
      talked to him of their hopes and aspirations. They would, when he had made
      plenty of money, go to England, to France, to Italy. They would, with him,
      see the quaint old church on the sands of Devon where their mother, and
      her mother too, had been christened so long, long ago. And Harvey had only
      shaken his head and smiled. They, he said, might go, but he had no care
      for such things; and he would work hard and make money for them until they
      married and wanted him no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then after a brief stay in the quiet little Australian country town
      where his sisters lived, he would again sail out to seek the ever-fleeting
      City of Fortune that has always tempted men like him into the South Seas,
      never to return to the world of civilisation, but with an intense, eager
      desire to leave it again as quickly as possible. To him the daily round of
      conventional existence, the visitings, the theatres, the church-goings,
      the talkings with well-dressed and highly cultured men and women, whose
      thoughts and life seemed to him to be deadly dull and uninteresting when
      contrasted with his own exciting life in the South Seas, palled upon and
      bored him to the verge of desperation. From his boyhood&mdash;from the
      time of his father's death he had moved among rough men&mdash;men who held
      their lives cheaply, but whose adventurous natures were akin to his own;
      men &ldquo;who never had 'listed,&rdquo; but who traded and sailed, and fought and
      died from bullet, or club, or deadly fever in the murderous Solomons or
      New Hebrides; men whose pioneering instinct and unrecorded daring has done
      so much for their country's flag and their country's prestige, but whose
      very names are forgotten by the time the quick-growing creeper and vine of
      the hot tropic jungle has hidden their graves from even the keen eye of
      the savage aboriginal. Go through a file of Australian newspapers from the
      year 1806 to the year 1900 and you will see how unknown Englishmen have
      died, and are dying, in those wild islands, and how as they die, by club,
      or spear, or bullet, or fever, how easily the young hot blood of other men
      of English race impels them to step into the vacant places. And it is well
      that it is so the wild wide world over, else would Britain be, not the
      mistress of the seas, but only a sharer of its sovereignty with France and
      Germany.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      About five years previous to his entering the service of Hillingdon and
      McFreeland, Carr had been mate of a trading vessel whose cruising-grounds
      were that vast chain of islands known as the Caroline Group, in the
      North-West Pacific, and there he had made the acquaintance of old John
      Remington and his family, an acquaintance that in the course of two or
      three years had deepened into a sincere friendship. The old trader was a
      man of means, and owned, in addition to his numerous trading stations
      throughout the North Pacific, a very smart schooner, of which eventually
      Carr took command, and sailed her for him for a couple of years. Then
      Remington, who, old as he was, was of an eager, adventurous disposition,
      decided to seek new fields for his enterprise among the low-lying
      equatorial islands to the south, and Carr and he parted, the former
      resuming his wanderings among the wild and murderous peoples of New
      Britain and the Solomon Archipelago. Since then they had never met, though
      the young man had heard that Remington, accompanied by one or more of his
      children, had opened up a trading business in the Gilbert Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exhausted with the violence of the fit of ague, Carr had dropped off into
      a broken slumber, from which he did not awaken till eight bells were
      struck, and the steward came to ask him to try and eat a little. Chard,
      Hendry and the two traders were below in the saloon, drinking, smoking,
      and talking business; Remington and his daughter, who had declined to join
      them at supper, were still on deck waiting for Carr to awaken; Malua,
      Carr's native servant, still sat beside his master, from whom he was never
      long absent, and from the main deck came the murmur of voices from the
      native crew, who were lying on their mats enjoying the cool breath of the
      evening land breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the young trader opened his eyes Tessa's father came over to
      him and they began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was delighted beyond words to learn you were on board, Harvey,&rdquo; said
      the old man. &ldquo;I didn't care about the idea of letting Tess go away under
      the care of strangers; but now I shall know that she will be well looked
      after, and that she will be in Ponapé in less than a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carr heard him in silence, then he said frankly, &ldquo;And I shall be delighted
      too; but, at the same time, I wish she were leaving you by any other ship
      than this. Cannot you keep her with you until one of the German ships come
      along? Is it necessary she must go home by this steamer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time is everything, Harvey. Her mother is ill, and wrote to me a few
      months ago, begging me, if I could not return myself, to at least try and
      send Tess home. The two other girls are married, as you know, and my two
      boys are both away&mdash;one is second mate on the <i>Jacinta</i>, of New
      Bedford, and the other is in California. And I can't leave Drummond's
      Island for another four months or so. I have made a good business here and
      throughout the group, and to leave it now to the care of any one else
      would mean a heavy loss to me. Then, you see, this steamer will land Tess
      at home in less than a month. If she waits for one of the German ships to
      call she may have to wait three or four months. And her mother wants her
      badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Carr was silent. He knew that Mrs. Remington had always been more or
      less of an invalid for many years. She was a Portuguese of Macao, and
      though her three daughters and two sons were strong and robust, she had
      always struck him as being of a delicate physique&mdash;the very
      antithesis of her husband, whose fame as an athlete was known from one end
      of the Pacific to the other. Presently Carr sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind going away, Tessa, for a few minutes?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to
      talk to your father on some business matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vivid flush spread over Tessa's pale cheeks. &ldquo;Oh, I'm so sorry, Harvey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and walked aft to where the mate was standing, and began to talk
      to him, her heart beating double quick time the while, for she had never
      forgotten Harvey Carr, though he had never spoken a word of love to her in
      the olden days when she was a girl of sixteen, and he was the master of
      her father's schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, and now, she thought, they would be together for nearly a month.
      And what were the &ldquo;business matters,&rdquo; she wondered, about which he wanted
      to speak to her father. Perhaps he was coming to them again! How
      hollow-cheeked, yellow, and dreadful he looked, except for his eyes, which
      were always kind and soft! She was nineteen, and was no longer the child
      she was three years ago, when, with her gun on her shoulder, she used to
      accompany Harvey Carr and her brothers out pigeon-shooting in the dark,
      silent mountain forest of Ponapé. And then, too, she knew she was
      beautiful; not so beautiful, perhaps, as her two sisters, Carmela and
      Librada, whom she had heard Harvey say were the handsomest girls he had
      ever seen. But yet&mdash;and again a pleasant flush tinged her pale cheeks&mdash;he
      had always liked to talk to her most, although she was only a girl of
      sixteen, just returned from school in California.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed softly to herself, and then looking up suddenly saw the
      kindly-faced mate regarding her with a smile in his honest grey eyes, for
      she was answering his questions at random, and he guessed that her
      thoughts were with the sick trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was out of hearing Carr spoke hurriedly, for he every
      moment expected to see either Chard or the captain appear on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; he said, speaking in the familiar manner borne out of their past
      comradeship, &ldquo;you know that I would do anything for you, don't you? But
      while I shall take good care of Tessa, I would rather she was going back
      home to Ponapé by any other ship than the <i>Motutapu</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is wrong with the ship, Harvey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. But the captain and supercargo are a pair of unmitigated
      scoundrels. I have seen a good deal of them since I came on board at New
      Britain, and I hate the idea of Tessa even having to sit at the same table
      with them. If I were free of this cursed fever, I wouldn't mind a bit, for
      I could protect her. But I'm no better than a helpless cripple most of the
      time, and one or the other, or both, of these fellows are bound to insult
      her, especially if they begin drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Remington put his hand on Carr's shoulder. &ldquo;You're a good boy, Harvey,
      and I know what you say of Chard at least, is true But have no fear for
      Tessa. She can take good care of herself at any time, and I have no fear
      for her. Just let me call her for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tessa,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;come here.&rdquo; Then speaking in Portuguese, he added,
      &ldquo;Show Harvey what you have in the bosom of your dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled a little wonderingly, and then putting her hand in the
      bosom of her yellow silk blouse, drew out a small Smith and Wesson
      revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry about Tessa, Harvey,&rdquo; added her father; &ldquo;she has not
      travelled around the Pacific with me for nothing, and if either that
      rat-faced Danish skipper or the fat supercargo meddles with her, she will
      do what I would do. So have no fear. And she is as anxious as I am myself
      to get home to her mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey was satisfied. &ldquo;Perhaps I am doing these two fellows an injustice,
      Jack. When a man has fever he always takes a black view of everything. And
      then I should remember that Malua here, and the mate, and nearly all the
      crew, will see that Tessa is not interfered with. I am sorry, however,
      that I shall not be with Tessa all the way to Ponapé&mdash;I am going
      ashore at the Mortlocks. There is a good opening there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be in too much of a hurry, Harvey. Now, listen to me. Go on to
      Ponapé. Leave this employ, and come in with me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey promised to think it over during the next few days; but the old man
      could see, to his regret, that the Mortlocks group of islands possessed a
      strong fascination for his young friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remington remained on board for the night; and then at daylight he bade
      Tessa and Harvey farewell and went ashore, and half an hour later the
      steamer had left the island, and was heading north-west for the Carolines.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Five days out from Drummond's Island Carr had so much improved in health
      that he was able to take his seat at the saloon table for breakfast, much
      to the annoyance of Chard, who had been making the best of his time in
      trying to produce a favourable impression upon Tessa Remington. He
      pretended, however, to be delighted to see the trader mending so rapidly,
      and was most effusive in his congratulations; and Hendry, of course,
      followed suit. Harvey responded civilly enough, while Tessa, who had
      learned from the chief mate of the treacherous part they were playing
      towards her friend, could not repress a scornful curl of her lip as she
      listened to Chard's jocular admonition to Harvey, &ldquo;to hurry up and put on
      some flesh, if only for the reputation of the cook of the <i>Motutapu</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after breakfast Carr went on deck again, and began to pace to
      and fro, enjoying the bright tropic sunshine and the cool breath of the
      trade wind. In a few minutes Tessa, accompanied by her native woman
      servant, appeared, followed by Chard and Captain Hendry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you come on the bridge, Miss Remington?&rdquo; said Chard, &ldquo;I'll take a
      chair up for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I would rather sit here under the awning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The supercargo and Hendry went up on the bridge together, where they could
      talk freely. The man at the wheel was a thick-set, rather stupid-looking
      native from Niué (Savage Island), who took no notice of their remarks, or
      at least appeared not to do so. But Huka was not such a fool as he looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You'll</i> stand little chance with her,&rdquo; said Hendry presently, in
      his usual low but sneering tones as he tugged viciously at his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supercargo's black eyes contracted, &ldquo;Wait and see, before you talk. I
      tell you that I mean to make that girl marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Marry</i> you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, marry me. The old man will leave her pretty well everything he has,
      and he has a lot. I've been making inquiries, and am quite satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you going to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know just yet. Must think it out. But I never yet knew the woman
      whom I could not work my own way with&mdash;by fair means or foul, as the
      penny novelists say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me that she likes that damned fellow. Look round presently and
      see for yourself. She's reading to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! That's nothing. He used to sail one of the old man's schooners, and
      of course they have a good deal to talk about. I'll settle <i>him</i> as
      far as she is concerned. Wait till I get a chance to talk to her a bit,&rdquo;
       and taking off his cap the supercargo passed his brawny hand through his
      curly hair with a smile of satisfaction. &ldquo;She'll be tired of talking to
      him before the day is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he going to land? Has he told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He wants to be put ashore at the Mortlocks Islands. We have no
      trader there, and he has lived there before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to see him go over the side in some new canvas, with a couple of
      fire bars slung to his heels,&rdquo; snarled Hendry viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; said Chard meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four bells the wheel was relieved, and Huka the Niué native trotted
      off, and immediately sent a message to Carr's servant Malua to come
      for'ard. The boy did as requested, and remained away for about ten
      minutes. When he returned he seated himself as usual near his master.
      Hendry was in his cabin on deck, Chard was below in the trade room, and
      only Tessa, Harvey, and himself were on the after-deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; he said in Fijian, to Harvey, &ldquo;listen to what Huka, the man of
      Niué, has told me. The captain and the supercargo have been talking about
      thee and the lady.&rdquo; Then he repeated all that which Huka had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The infernal scoundrels!&rdquo; Harvey could not help exclaiming. &ldquo;But they
      won't get rid of me as easily as they think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Harvey?&rdquo; asked Tessa, anxiously bending forward to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trader thought a moment or two before speaking. Then he decided to
      tell her what he had just heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed contemptuously. &ldquo;<i>His</i> wife! <i>His</i> wife!&rdquo; she
      repeated scornfully. &ldquo;If he knew what my father knows of him, and how I
      hate and despise him, he would not have said that. Does he think that
      because my mother was a Portuguese, I am no better than some native slave
      girl whom he could buy from her master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey smiled gravely as he looked into her flashing eyes, and saw her
      clench her hands angrily. Then he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a dangerous man though, Tessa. And now listen to me. When I came on
      board this steamer I intended to land at the Mortlocks Islands. But I
      think now that I will go on to Ponapé.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not change your plans, Harvey, on my account. I am not afraid of this
      man. He dare not insult me, for fear my father would hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him too well, Tessa. He and the skipper are, I fear, a pair of
      cunning, treacherous villains. And so I am going on to Ponapé. And I will
      stay there until your father returns. I daresay,&rdquo; he added with a smile,
      &ldquo;that he will give me a berth as a trader somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden joy illumined the girl's face. &ldquo;I <i>am</i> so glad, Harvey. And
      mother, too, will be overjoyed to see you again; father has never ceased
      to talk about you since you left him. Oh, Harvey, we shall have all the
      old, old delightful days over again. But,&rdquo; she added artlessly, &ldquo;there
      will be but you and I now to go fishing and shooting together. Carmela and
      her husband are living in the Ladrones, and Librada and her husband,
      though they are still on Ponapé, are ten miles away from mother and I.
      Then Jack is in California, and Ned is away on a whaling cruise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quick emotion stirred his bosom as he looked into her now joyous face.
      &ldquo;I don't think you and I can go out shooting and fishing together, Tessa,
      as we did in what you call 'the old, old days.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't we, Harvey?&rdquo; she asked wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, and then mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tessa, I wish you could meet my sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands together. &ldquo;Ah, so do I, Harvey. I should love to
      meet them. Do you think they would like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure they would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a while, the girl with her head bent and her long
      lashes hiding her eyes from him as she sat in the deck-chair, and he
      thinking of what his sisters would really say if he wrote and told them
      that he thought he had at last found a woman he would wish to make his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tessa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Harvey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not look at him, only bent her head still lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tessa!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Harvey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands were trembling, and her courage was gone, for there was
      something in his voice that filled her with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tessa,&rdquo; he said, speaking softly, as he drew nearer to her, and tried to
      make her look at him; &ldquo;do you know that you are a very beautiful woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you think so, Harvey,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You used to tell father
      that Carmela and Librada were the most beautiful women you had ever seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they were. But you are quite as beautiful. And, Tessa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Harvey&rdquo;&mdash;this in the faintest whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you care for me at all, Tessa? I do not mean as a friend. I am only
      a poor trader, but if I thought you could love-me, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took a quick glance around the deck, and bent towards him. &ldquo;I have
      always loved you, Harvey; always, always.&rdquo; Then she pressed her lips to
      his, and in another moment was gone.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Harvey, with a sense of elation in his heart, walked for'ard to where
      Morrison was standing in the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, man, ye look as if ye could take the best man aboard on for four
      rounds,&rdquo; said the engineer, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do feel pretty fit, Morrison,&rdquo; laughed the trader; &ldquo;have you anything
      to drink in your cabin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some real Loch Dhu, <i>not</i> made in Sydney. Man, your eye is as bright
      as a boy's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Just before eight bells were struck Chard came on deck. He was carefully
      dressed in shining, well-starched white duck, and his dark,
      coarsely-handsome face was aglow with satisfaction; he meant to &ldquo;rub it
      in&rdquo; to Carr, and was only awaiting till Tessa Remington and Captain Hendry
      were present to hear him do it. He knew she would be on deck in a minute
      or so, and Hendry he could see was sitting at his cabin table with his
      chart before him. Harvey was strolling about on the main deck, smoking his
      first pipe for many weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Tessa appeared with her woman attendant. She, too, had dressed
      in white, and for the time had discarded the wide Panama hat she usually
      wore. Her face was radiant with happiness as she took the deck-chair which
      Chard brought, and disposed herself comfortably, book in hand. She had
      seen Harvey on the main deck, and knew she would at least have him with
      her for a few minutes before dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hendry stepped out from his cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, Miss Remington. You give an atmosphere of coolness to the whole ship.
      Mr. Chard, big as he is, is only a minor reflection of your dazzling
      whiteness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Captain Hendry. I am quite sure that my father will be
      astonished to learn that I have been paid so many compliments on board the
      <i>Motutapu</i>. Had he known that you and Mr. Chard were such flatterers
      he would not have let me come away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither Chard nor Hendry could detect the ring of mockery in her tones.
      They drew their chairs up near to that in which she was sitting and lit
      their cigars, and she, impatient for Harvey, talked and laughed with them,
      and wished them far away. Less than two hours before she had felt an
      intense hatred of them, now she had but a quiet contempt for both the
      handsome, &ldquo;good-natured&rdquo; supercargo and his sneaking, grey-bearded jackal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight bells struck, and presently Carr ascended the poop deck, took in the
      little group on the starboard side of the skylight, and went over to his
      own lounge, beside which his watchful servant was seated. He knew that
      Tessa would be alone in a few minutes, and he was quite satisfied to wait
      till Chard and the Dane left her free.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay back in the lounge, and lazily conversed with Malua. Then Chard,
      who had been watching him keenly, rose from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray excuse me for a few minutes, Miss Remington. Even <i>your</i>
      charming society must not make me forget business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke so loudly that Carr could not fail to hear him, but he was quite
      prepared, and indeed had been on the alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chard walked up to within a few feet of the trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to come below, Mr. Carr, and pick out your trade goods for the
      Mortlocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey leant back in his lounge. &ldquo;I don't think I shall require any goods
      for the Mortlocks Islands, Mr. Chard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; and Chard's face flushed with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean exactly what I say,&rdquo; replied Carr nonchalantly. &ldquo;I say that I
      shall not want any trade goods for the Mortlocks Islands. I have decided
      not to take another station from the firm of Hillingdon and McFreeland. I
      have had enough of them&mdash;and enough of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chard took a threatening step towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back, Mr. Chard. I am not a man to be threatened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in his eyes warned the supercargo, whose temper, however, was
      rapidly taking possession of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Carr,&rdquo; he said sneeringly; &ldquo;do I understand you to say
      that you refuse to continue your engagement with our firm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by God, I'll dump you ashore at the first island we sight. The firm
      will be glad to be rid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't doubt the latter part of your assertion; but their satisfaction
      will be nothing to equal mine,&rdquo; he said with cutting irony. &ldquo;But you'll
      not 'dump' me ashore anywhere. I am going to land at Ponapé, and nowhere
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Chard took a step nearer, his face purpling with rage; and then, as
      Hendry came to his side with scowling eyes, Tessa quickly slipped past
      them, and stood near her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll land at Ponapé, will you?&rdquo; sneered the supercargo, &ldquo;It's lucky for
      you we are not in port now, for I'd kick you ashore right-away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The insult had the desired effect, for, weak as he was, Harvey sprang
      forward and struck Chard full upon the mouth, but almost at the same
      moment the captain, who had quietly possessed himself of a brass
      belaying-pin, dealt him a blow on the back of the neck which felled him to
      the deck, and then bending on one knee, he would have repeated the blow on
      Harvey's upturned face, when Tessa sprang at him like a tigress, and
      struck him again and again on the temple with her revolver. He fell back,
      bleeding and half stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cowards&mdash;you pair of miserable curs!&rdquo; she cried to Chard, who
      was standing with his handkerchief to his lips, glaring savagely at the
      prostrate figure of Harvey. &ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; and she covered him with her
      weapon, as he made a step towards her, &ldquo;stand back, or I will shoot you
      dead.&rdquo; Then as the second mate, Huka, and another native appeared on the
      poop, she sank on her knees beside Harvey, and called for water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hendry, whose face was streaming with blood, though he was but little
      hurt, rose to his feet and addressed the second mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Atkins, put that man in irons,&rdquo; and he pointed to Harvey, who was now
      sitting up, with Tessa holding a glass of water to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second mate eyed his captain sullenly. &ldquo;He is scarcely conscious yet,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you refuse to obey me? Quick, answer me. Where is the mate? Mr. Chard,
      I call on you to support my authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey looked at the second mate, whose features were working curiously.
      He rose and pressed Tessa's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must obey him, Atkins,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you don't he'll break you. He's
      a spiteful hound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atkins, with a sorrowful face, went to his cabin and returned with a pair
      of handcuffs, just as the chief officer appeared. As he stepped on the
      poop he was followed by half-a-dozen of the native crew, who advanced
      towards Hendry and the supercargo with threatening glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go for'ard, you swine!&rdquo; shouted Chard, who saw that they meant a rescue.
      He darted into Hendry's cabin, and reappeared with the captain's
      revolvers, one of which he handed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvey looked contemptuously at the supercargo, then turning to the
      natives he spoke to them in Samoan, and earnestly besought them to go
      for'ard, telling them of the penalties they would suffer if they disputed
      the captain's authority. They obeyed him with reluctance, and left the
      poop. Then he held out his hands to the second mate, who snapped the
      handcuffs on his wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him to the for'ard deck-house,&rdquo; snarled Hendry viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest against this, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver respectfully. &ldquo;I beg of you to
      beware of what you are doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hendry gave him a furious glance, but his rage choked his utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tessa Remington followed the prisoner to the break of the poop and
      whispered to him ere he descended the ladder. He nodded and smiled. Then
      she turned and faced Chard and the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would like to put me in irons too, gentlemen,&rdquo; she said
      mockingly. &ldquo;I am not very strong, though stronger than Mr. Carr has been
      for many months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain eyed her with sudden malevolence; Chard, bully as he was, with
      a secret admiration as she stood before them, still holding her revolver
      in her hand. She faced them in an attitude of defiance for a second or
      two, and then with a scornful laugh swept by them and went below to her
      cabin.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      At six o'clock that evening the <i>Motutapu</i> was plunging into a heavy
      head sea, for the wind had suddenly hauled round to the northeast and
      raised a mountainous swell. Chard and his jackal were seated in the
      latter's cabin on deck. A half-emptied bottle of brandy was on the table,
      and both men's faces were flushed with drink, for this was the second
      bottle since noon. Hendry did not present a pleasant appearance, for
      Tessa's pistol had cut deeply into his thin, tough face, which was
      liberally adorned with strips of plaster. The liquor he had taken had also
      turned his naturally red face into a purple hue, and his steely blue eyes
      seemed to have dilated to twice their size, as he listened with venomous
      interest to Chard. &ldquo;Now, look here, Louis,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;both you and
      I want to get even with him, don't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only when the supercargo was planning some especial piece of
      villainy that he addressed his <i>confrere</i> by his Christian name.
      Secretly he despised him as a &ldquo;damned Dutchman,&rdquo; to his face he flattered
      him; for he was a useful and willing tool, and during the three or four
      years they had sailed together had materially assisted the &ldquo;good-natured,
      jovial&rdquo; supercargo in his course of steady peculation. Yet neither trusted
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I do,&rdquo; replied Hendry; &ldquo;but I'd like to get even with that
      spiteful little half-bred Portuguese devil&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, Louis, steady,&rdquo; said Chard, with a half-drunken leer; &ldquo;you must
      remember that she is to be Mrs. Samuel Chard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think you have the ghost of a chance, as I said before. She's in
      love with that fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she must get out of love with him. I tell you, Louis&rdquo;&mdash;here he
      struck his fist on the table&mdash;&ldquo;that I mean to make her marry me. And
      she'll be <i>glad</i> to marry me before we get to Ponapé. And if you
      stick to me and help to pull me through, it's a hundred quid for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you going to do it?&rdquo; and the captain bent forward his foxy face
      and grinned in anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same old way as with that Raratongan girl last year. She'll go to sleep
      after supper, and I can open any door in the saloon, as you know, don't
      you, old man?&rdquo; and he laughed coarsely. &ldquo;Dear, dear, what times we have
      had together, Louis, my esteemed churchwarden of Darling Point, Sydney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dane tugged at his beard, and then poured out some brandy for himself
      and his fellow scoundrel. &ldquo;We have, we have, Sam,&rdquo; he said, uneasily. &ldquo;But
      what about the native woman who sleeps with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The native woman, when <i>she</i> awakes, my Christian friend, will find
      herself in the trade-room in the company of Mr. Tim Donnelly, one of the
      firemen. And Mr. Tim Donnelly, to whom I have given two sovereigns, will
      bear me out, if necessary, that 'the woman tempted him, and he did fall.'
      Also he will be prepared to swear that this native woman, Maoni, told him
      that her mistress expected a visit from Mr. Chard, and had asked her to be
      out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that, my dear Christian friend, with the rudely executed diagrams
      in sticking-plaster on the facial cuticle, my pious churchwarden with the
      large family of interesting girls&mdash;after that, Miss Tessa Remington
      will be glad to marry Mr. Samuel Chard, inasmuch as when <i>she</i> awakes
      it will be under the same improper conditions as those of the dissolute
      Tim Donnelly and the flighty Miss Maoni; for the beauteous Tessa will be
      fortuitously discovered by Captain Louis Hendry and several other persons
      on board, in such circumstances that an immediate marriage of the
      indiscreet lovers by one of the American missionaries at Ponapé will
      present the only solution of what would otherwise be a 'terrible
      scandal.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will you do with this fellow Carr?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chuck him ashore at the Mortlocks,&rdquo; replied Chard with an oath; &ldquo;we'll be
      there in a couple of days, and I'll kick him over the side if he turns
      rusty. Hillingdon doesn't like him, so we are quite safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is the love-making to come off?&rdquo; asked Hendry, with a fiend-like
      grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as we are clear of Carr&mdash;or sooner; to-night maybe. We must
      log it that he was continually trying to cause the native crew to mutiny,
      and that for the safety of the ship we got rid of him. Hillingdon will
      back us up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Tessa did not appear at supper. She kept to her cabin with Maoni, her dear
      Maoni, who, though but little older than herself, was as a mother to her;
      for the native girl had been brought up with her and her sisters from
      their infancy. And as Tessa lay back with her dark head pillowed against
      the bosom of the native girl, and sobbed as she thought of her lover lying
      in the deck-house with the handcuffs on his wrists, Maoni pressed her lips
      to those of her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie there, little one, lay thy head on my bosom,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;'tis a bad
      day for thee, but yet all will be well soon. These sailor men with the
      brown skins will not let thy lover be hurt. That much do I know already.
      Speak but one word, and the captain and the big fat man with the black
      eyes will be dead men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tessa smiled through her tears. &ldquo;Nay, Maoni, that must not be; I desire no
      man's death. But yet if he be not set free to-morrow trouble will come of
      it, for he hath done nothing wrong; and the brown men, as thou sayest,
      have a strong friendship for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall be set free to-morrow,&rdquo; said Maoni, with quiet emphasis. &ldquo;The
      brown sailor men have talked together over this thing, and they say that
      they are ready at thy word to make captive the captain, the big fat man,
      and all those white men who tend the great fires in the belly of the
      ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tessa knew that the half-dozen of white firemen and stokers were on bad
      terms with the native crew. They were a ruffianly, drunken set of
      scoundrels, and their leader, a powerfully built man named Donnelly, had
      grossly insulted both the first and second mates. He was an especial <i>protégé</i>
      of the supercargo, who, as well as the captain, secretly encouraged him
      and his fellows to annoy and exasperate the two officers and the chief
      engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained in their cabin talking together in low tones and without a
      light till they heard eight bells strike; and ten minutes afterwards, just
      as they were going on deck, some one tapped at the cabin door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is me, Miss Remington,&rdquo; said the voice of Oliver; &ldquo;please let me come
      in for a moment. Be quick, please, as I don't want the captain to know I
      am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tessa at once opened the door. &ldquo;Come in Mr. Oliver. But we have no light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that, miss,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, carefully closing the
      door and then bolting it, &ldquo;I cannot stay long. I came to warn you that
      there is likely to be trouble tonight about Mr. Carr, and you had better
      not come on deck. Keep to your cabin, and don't open your door to any one
      except myself, the second mate, or the steward. The native crew are in a
      dangerous state of excitement, and I am sure they will attempt to liberate
      Mr. Carr before morning. Both the captain and Chard are more than
      half-drunk; and the chief engineer tells me that for some reason they have
      given liquor to the firemen and stokers, who have set him at defiance. I
      fear, I fear greatly, miss, that some calamity may occur on board this
      ship to-night. Therefore I beg of you to keep to your cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much, Mr. Oliver. We certainly did intend to go on deck
      and remain some hours, but shall not do so now. But tell me, please, have
      you seen Mr. Carr? Is he well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well. I saw him a few minutes ago, and he bade me tell you to have
      no fear for him. I am now again going to Captain Hendry to ask him, for
      his own and the ship's safety, to set Mr. Carr free. If he refuses I
      cannot say what will happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tessa put her little hand upon the mate's huge, rough paw, and looked into
      his honest, troubled eyes through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good of you,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Oh, do try, Mr. Oliver, try your best
      to make the captain set him at liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will, miss,&rdquo; replied the mate earnestly, as he pressed her hand,
      and went softly out into the main cabin. He stood by the table for a
      minute or two, thinking with wrinkled brow of the best way to approach the
      captain and bring him to reason. Presently he sat down, took his pipe from
      his pocket, filled it, and began to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy step sounded on the companion steps, and Chard descended somewhat
      unsteadily, and calling for the second steward&mdash;who was in the pantry&mdash;to
      come to him, brushed past the chief officer, and went into his own cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second steward&mdash;a dirty, evil-faced little cockney named Jessop,
      whom Oliver and his fellow officers particularly abhorred&mdash;at once
      followed the supercargo in to his cabin, which was immediately closed. In
      less than five minutes it opened again, and Jessop came out and returned
      to the pantry, and presently Oliver heard the rattle of cups and saucers
      as the man made preparations for the coffee which was always served to
      Hendry, Chard, Carr, and Tessa and her attendant, and the officer on watch
      at nine o'clock every evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like a cup of coffee, sir, as you have not turned in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Jessop who was speaking, and Oliver looked up in some wonder, for
      the man knew that he disliked him, and indeed he (Oliver) had once smartly
      cuffed him for creating a disturbance for'ard with the native crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most fortunately for himself, Oliver did not want any coffee, so merely
      giving the man a gruff &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; he rose and went on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he was out of the cabin Chard appeared, and looked inquiringly
      at the second steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'E won't 'ave any, blarst him!&rdquo; said the man, speaking in a whisper, for
      Latour, the chief steward, was in his cabin, which was abreast the
      trade-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chard uttered a curse. &ldquo;Never mind him, then. Sling it out of the port or
      you'll be giving it to me instead perhaps. Are the other two cups ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded. &ldquo;All ready, but it's a bit early yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't matter. Pour it out and take it to them&mdash;the sooner the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chard, whose dark face was deeply flushed, sat down at the table, lit a
      cigar, and watched his villainous accomplice place the two cups of coffee
      with some biscuits on a tray, take it to Miss Remington's door and knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, steward,&rdquo; he heard Tessa's soft voice reply as Maoni opened
      the door and took the tray from Jessop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supercargo rose from his seat with a smile of satisfaction. The crime
      he meditated seemed no crime to his base and vicious heart. He merely
      regarded it as a clever trick; dangerous perhaps, but not dangerous to
      him; for deeply steeped as he was in numerous villainies he had never yet
      been called to account for any one of his misdeeds, and long immunity had
      rendered him utterly hardened and callous to any sentiment of pity or
      remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on deck and walked leisurely for'ard till he came abreast of the
      funnel. A big swarthy-faced man who was standing near the ash-hoist was
      awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sober enough, Tim, not to make any mistakes?&rdquo; asked Chard,
      leaning forward and looking eagerly into the man's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as sober as you are,&rdquo; was the reply, given with insolent
      familiarity. &ldquo;I've kept my head pretty clear, as clear as yours and the
      skipper's, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two conversed for a few minutes, and then separated, the supercargo
      going up on the bridge to join his jackal. Half-way up the ladder he heard
      the sound of angry voices. Hendry was quarrelling with his chief officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and keep your watch below,&rdquo; said the captain furiously, his bloodshot
      eyes glaring fiercely upon the mate. &ldquo;I tell you that I'll keep the beggar
      in irons till he rots in them, or until Mr. Chard kicks him ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver quietly, placing his hand on the bridge rail
      to steady himself, for the <i>Motutapu</i> was now plunging and labouring
      in the heavy head sea, and Hendry was staggering about all over the bridge&mdash;&ldquo;very
      well. But I call on Mr. Atkins here to witness that I now tell you that
      you are putting the ship into great danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say another word to me, and by God I'll put you with your friend Carr to
      keep him company!&rdquo; shouted Hendry, who had now completely lost control of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver smiled contemptuously, but made no answer. He at once descended the
      bridge, and in the starboard alleyway met the chief engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a nice state of affairs, Oliver. Those blackguards of mine are
      half-drunk, and unless I get some assistance from the captain I can't keep
      up steam. They won't work and are saucy as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate shook his head. &ldquo;You'll get no help from the captain. He and I
      have just had a flare-up. He's half-drunk himself, and threatened to put
      me in irons. And none of the native crew will go into the stokehole,
      that's certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, something serious will happen. I can keep her going at four or
      five knots for another hour or so, and that is all I can do. The second
      engineer and myself are dead-beat. She'll broach-to presently, and then
      you will see a pretty mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it, Morrison,&rdquo; said the mate gloomily, as he went to his
      cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up on the bridge Hendry and Chard were talking and looking out ahead. The
      second mate, a young, muscular man, was standing by the wheel, and giving
      a word of warning now and then to the native helmsman, who was Huka.
      Although it was not blowing hard the sea had increased greatly, and every
      now and then the steamer would make a plunge into a mighty valley of
      darkness, and only struggle up out of it with difficulty. Careful steering
      was a necessity, for the ship was not steaming more than four knots, and
      the least inattention might result in serious consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for'ard!&rdquo; Atkins shouted, as he saw a particularly loose, knobby
      sea rise suddenly up over the starboard bow. His warning was just given in
      time, for in another moment down dropped the black mass of water on the
      well deck with a thundering crash, burying the steamer completely from the
      bridge to foc'scle head. She rose slowly, very slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hendry lurched up towards the helmsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You damned, red-hided kanaka! Couldn't you see that coming?&rdquo; and he
      struck the man a violent blow on the mouth. In an instant Huka let go the
      wheel, swung himself over the rail on to the deck, and ran for'ard. Atkins
      looked at his captain with suppressed rage as he seized the wheel, and
      then began to watch for the next sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes passed, and then a dozen dark figures made a sudden rush
      towards the deckhouse in which Carr lay in irons. Then came the sound of
      smashing blows as the door was burst open with an axe, and in a few
      seconds Carr was brought out upon the main deck and quickly freed from his
      irons by Malua, to whom a duplicate key had been given by the second mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Chard and Hendry scarcely comprehended what had happened, so
      sudden was the onslaught, but when they saw Carr standing free on the main
      hatch they both made a rush aft towards Hendry's deck cabin. This they
      gained without opposition, and seizing two loaded Winchesters which lay in
      the captain's berth they darted out again, and began firing into the group
      of excited native seamen ten paces away. Three men at once dropped, either
      killed or wounded; but the rest, nothing daunted at this, made a rush
      towards the two men, knives in hand, bore them down to the deck by sheer
      weight, and in a few seconds would have ended their lives had not Carr,
      Oliver, and Latour the steward flung themselves into the fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, stop!&rdquo; cried Oliver, &ldquo;the ship is on fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then seizing Hendry by the throat, he lifted him to his feet, and
      shook him as a terrier shakes a rat. &ldquo;You damned, drunken villain! You are
      not in a fit state to take charge. Lie there, you brute, and let better
      men try to save the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swung Hendry's slight figure to and fro, and then sent him reeling, to
      fall like a log on the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;we are in great danger, the trade-room is on fire!
      Atkins, for God's sake try to keep us head to wind. Mr. Carr, you and some
      of the hands see to the boats. There are over fifty cases of powder in the
      for'ard end of the trade-room, and we can't shift them; but only the after
      part is burning so far. Steward, see to Miss Remington. Her cabin is
      locked, and I cannot make her hear. She and her maid must be awakened at
      once. Pass the word to Mr. Morrison to get the fire hose aft. Some of you
      cut a hole here in the deck on the port side, just abreast of that
      bollard. Smart's the word and quick's the action, or we shall all be blown
      to hell in ten minutes if we can't flood the trade-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped to give a brief scrutiny to the prone figure of Mr. Samuel
      Chard, who had been struck a smashing blow on the head from the butt of
      his own Winchester, which Huka had wrested from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put this beast into one of the boats, Mr. Carr. We must not leave the
      blackguard here, as he is not dead, and we can't save the ship, I fear.
      Now then, hurry along that hose.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whilst the chief mate, aided by the now willing crew, ran aft the hose and
      set to work to flood the trade-room, Latour the steward, a smart little
      Frenchman, taking a man with him, jumped below and knocked loudly at the
      door of Tessa's cabin, which was the foremost but one of five on the
      starboard side, the intervening one separating it from the trade-room.
      There was no answer to his repeated cries and knocking. Then he and the
      native sailor each tried to force the door, but it defied their efforts,
      and then, as they paused for a moment, they heard the crackling sound of
      fire within a few feet of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The native seaman, a big, square-shouldered Manhikian, looked around the
      main cabin for a second; then he darted into the second mate's cabin, and
      returned with a carpenter's broad axe. One smashing blow with the back of
      the tool started the lock, and a second sent the door flying open.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp was burning brightly, but both Tessa and Maoni were sunk in a
      heavy slumber, and although Latour called loudly to them to arise, they
      made no answer, though Tessa tried to sit up, and her lips moved as she
      muttered incoherently, only to fall back again with closed eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to lose. Latour lifted Tessa out of her berth, and
      followed by the native, who carried Maoni, they hurried up the
      companion-way, and laid the two girls down upon the quarter-deck, where
      Malua took charge of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly ten minutes the mate and crew worked hard to subdue the fire,
      and all might have gone well had there been a sufficient head of steam to
      keep the ship head to wind and the donkey-engine going, but at the first
      alarm the drunken, cowardly firemen had refused duty and tried to rush one
      of the boats, and amidst the curses and blows which Carr and Atkins were
      showering upon them another mighty sea tumbled aboard for'ard, and the <i>Motutapu</i>
      was half-smothered again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrison crawled up exhaustedly on the deck from the engine-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a case as far as steaming goes, Mr. Atkins. I'm done up. Send some
      one down into the stokehole for Mr. Studdert. He dropped a minute ago. But
      if you'll give me a couple of your men I can keep the engines going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use, Morrison. None of my men would go into the stokehole to
      work, but they'll bring Mr. Studdert up quick enough. The ship is doomed,
      so don't bother. We'll have to take to the boats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Motutapu</i> was indeed doomed, for, despite the frantic efforts of
      Oliver and the native crew, the fire had gained complete possession of the
      saloon, though every opening on deck had been battened down and all cabin
      ports had been closed. Most fortunately, however, the fore part of the
      trade-room, where the powder was stowed, had been thoroughly saturated,
      and both Oliver and Atkins felt assured that no danger need be apprehended
      from that source.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the engines ceased to work, but the donkey-engine on
      deck, with its furnace filled with cotton waste soaked in kerosene, kept
      the hose going, and sent a steady stream of water through the hole cut in
      the after-deck. Meanwhile Harvey and the second mate, aided by the
      energetic little French steward, had made good progress with the boats,
      all three of which were ready for lowering, and contained some provisions
      and water. Such fore and aft canvas as the steamer carried was set, so as
      to keep her to the wind as much as possible, and help to steady her. Then,
      seeing that the flames were bursting through the sides of the saloon
      skylight, and that the ship would scarcely answer her helm under such
      miserable canvas, Oliver abandoned all hope of saving her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready, sir?&rdquo; replied Atkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then before they could be stopped the firemen made a rush for the best
      boat of the three, a fine new whaler, hanging in davits just abaft the
      bridge. Four of them jumped into her, the remaining two cast off the
      falls, and began to lower away hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cowardly dogs!&rdquo; shouted the second mate, rushing up to the nearest
      man, tearing the after-fall out of his hands, and making it fast again
      round the cleet, and then springing at the other man, who paused
      irresolutely, intimidated by Atkin's threatening visage. But though he
      paused but momentarily, it was fatal, for the instant the mate's back was
      turned the first man, with an oath of drunken defiance, cast off the fall
      and let it go with a run, just as the <i>Motutapu</i> was heaved up by a
      lofty sea, and rolled heavily to port.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry of terror burst from the four doomed men in the boat, as they fell
      headlong into the sea, and she hung by the for'ard fall, straight up and
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them drown!&rdquo; roared Atkins to some native seamen who sprang to his
      assistance, &ldquo;overboard two or three of you, and save the boat. She'll be
      smashed to matchwood in a minute, the after-fall has unshipped;&rdquo; then
      whipping a knife from the belt of one of them he severed the remaining
      fall, and saw the boat plunge down sternwards and outwards from the side
      just in time; another half-minute and she would have disappeared under the
      steamer's bottom to be hopelessly stove in. And with cries of
      encouragement to each other, four natives leapt over the side, swam after
      her, clambered in and then shouted that they were all right, and would
      come alongside and stand by, for although the oars and other fittings had
      been lost, there were half a dozen canoe paddles lashed under the thwarts,
      and these were quickly brought into use.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this happened in a few minutes, and as Atkins ran to assist Harvey
      with the two quarter boats which had been lowered, and were now standing
      by alongside, there came a sudden crashing of glass, as the flames in the
      saloon burst through the sides of the skylight, and drove every one to the
      main deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles the matter,&rdquo; said Oliver quietly to Harvey, as a sudden gust
      of flame leapt from the lee side of the skylight, and caught the fore and
      aft mainsail, which was quickly destroyed; then the steamer at once fell
      off, and the flames began to travel for'ard.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all possible speed, but without excitement, Tessa and Maoni, who were
      still under the influence of the drugged coffee, and unable to stand, or
      even utter a word, were placed in the first boat, of which Atkins took
      charge for the time, with four natives as a crew. The second quarter boat,
      in which Hendry and Chard had been placed, then came alongside, and the
      two surviving firemen, now thoroughly cowed and trembling, and terrified
      into a mechanical sobriety, were brought to the gangway and told to jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump, you rotten beggars, jump,&rdquo; said Morrison; &ldquo;over you go into the
      water if you want to save your useless lives. The men in the boat will
      pick you up. We are not going to risk bringing her alongside for the sake
      of swine like you. Over you go,&rdquo; and then seizing one of them by the
      collar of his shirt and the belt, he sent him flying over the side, the
      other man jumping over to avoid rougher treatment from the native seamen,
      who were disgusted at their cowardice. Then Morrison, Studdert, and three
      natives followed, and the boat pulled away clear of the ship, and stood
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull up, boys!&rdquo; cried Oliver to the men in the third boat&mdash;the one
      which the firemen had rushed. Then turning to Latour, who was standing
      near him with a sack half full of heavy articles&mdash;firearms,
      ammunition, the ship's books, etc.&mdash;he bade him go first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disdaining to wait for the boat to come alongside the little Frenchman
      sprang over the side and swam to the boat; then the bag&mdash;its contents
      too precious to be wetted&mdash;was adroitly lowered and caught by one of
      the hands. Jessop, the second steward, whose limbs were shaking with
      terror, was told to jump, but pleaded that he could not swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You miserable hound!&rdquo; cried Oliver fiercely, and he raised his hand to
      strike him; then a scornful pity took the place of anger, and he ordered
      the boat to come alongside so that he could get in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now's your chance, you dirty little cur,&rdquo; he said, as the boat's bow came
      within a foot of the steamer's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear-stricken man jumped, fell short, and in an instant disappeared
      under the ship, as she rolled suddenly to starboard. When he came to the
      surface again it was at the stern, with several broken ribs, he having
      struck against the propeller. He was, however, soon rescued and placed in
      safety, and then but three natives and Harvey and Oliver remained on
      board. The natives went first, the white men quickly followed, and
      clambered into the boat, which at once joined the two others, and then all
      three lay to, and their occupants watched the <i>Motutapu</i> drifting
      before the wind, with the red flames enveloping her from stern to stem.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Ordering the other boats to remain close to him until further orders, but
      to steer W. by N. if anything should part them from him during the night,
      Oliver and Harvey, as they watched the burning steamer lighting up the
      heaving sea for miles around, discussed their future plans, and quickly
      resolved upon a certain course of action to be followed in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards midnight the wind died away entirely, and an hour later the heavy,
      lumpy sea changed into a long, sweeping swell. A mile to leeward the <i>Motutafu</i>
      still blazed fiercely, and sent up vast volumes of smoke and flame from
      her forehold, where some hundreds of cases of kerosene were stowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three boats were pretty close together, and Harvey, exhausted by the
      events of the day, and knowing that Tessa was safe with the second mate,
      was just dozing off into a &ldquo;monkey's sleep&rdquo; when he was awakened by a hail
      from Atkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Atkins?&rdquo; cried Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're all right, sir; but Miss Remington has just come to, and is asking
      for Mr. Carr, so I said I'd hail you just to show her that he is with you.
      Better let me come alongside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver looked at Harvey with something like a smile in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Atkins,&rdquo; he replied, and then to Harvey, &ldquo;Here, wake up
      young-fellow-my-lad, and get into the other boat with your sweetheart. I
      don't want you here. What's the use of you if you haven't even a bit of
      tobacco to give me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The second mate's boat drew alongside, and in another minute Harvey was
      seated in the stern sheets with Tessa's cheek against his own, and her
      arms round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any of you fellows got any tobacco, and a pipe to spare?&rdquo; said the
      prosaic Oliver. &ldquo;If you haven't, sheer off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lashings of everything,&rdquo; said Atkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are: two pipes, matches, bottle of Jimmy Hennessy, and some
      water and biscuits. What more can you want? Who wouldn't sell a farm and
      go to sea?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      At sunrise the three boats were all within a half-mile of each other,
      floating upon a smooth sea of the deepest blue. Overhead the vault of
      heaven was unflecked by a single cloud, though far away on the eastern
      sea-rim a faintly curling bank gave promise of a breeze before the sun
      rose much higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a signal from Oliver the second mate pulled up, and he, Harvey, and the
      chief mate again held a brief consultation. Then Harvey went back to
      Oliver, and both boats came together, rowing in company alongside that of
      the captain's, no one speaking, and all feeling that sense of something
      impending, born of a sudden silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain's boat was steered by Huka, the Savage Islander; Hendry
      himself was sitting beside Chard in the stern sheets, Morrison and
      Studdert amidships amidst the native crew, whose faces were sullen and
      lowering, for in the bottom of the boat one of their number, who had been
      shot in the stomach by either the captain or Chard, was dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hendry's always forbidding face was even more lowering than usual as his
      eyes turned upon the chief officer. Chard, whose head was bound up in a
      bloodstained handkerchief, smiled in his frank, jovial manner as he rose,
      lifted his cap to Tessa, and nodded pleasantly to Oliver and Harvey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are your orders, sir?&rdquo; asked the chief mate addressing the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hendry gave him a look of murderous hatred, and his utterance almost
      choked him as he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall give my orders presently. But where are the other firemen&mdash;five
      of them are missing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six of them rushed this boat,&rdquo; answered the mate quietly; &ldquo;two of them&mdash;those
      scoundrels there,&rdquo; and he pointed to the two in Hendry's boat, &ldquo;let the
      after fall go by the run, and drowned the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold you responsible for the death of those men,&rdquo; said Hendry
      vindictively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; answered the mate, &ldquo;but this is not the time nor place
      to talk about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; broke in Atkins fiercely; &ldquo;no more is it the time or place to charge
      you, Captain Hendry, and you, Mr. Chard, with the murder of the two native
      seamen whose bodies we saw lying on the main hatch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hendry's face paled, and even Chard, self-possessed as he always was,
      caught his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We fired on those men to suppress a mutiny&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Hendry,
      when Oliver stopped him with an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are your orders, I ask you for the second time?&rdquo; and from the
      natives there came a hissing sound, expressive of their hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chard muttered under his breath, &ldquo;Be careful, Louis, be careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the second steward raised himself from the bottom of Oliver's
      boat, where he had been lying, groaning in agony, and pointed a shaking
      finger at Chard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the man who caused it all,&rdquo; he half sobbed, half screamed. &ldquo;'E
      told me to let Tim Donnelly go into the trade-room, and it was Donnelly
      who upset the lamp and set the ship afire. 'E sent Donnelly to 'ell, and
      'e's sending me there, too, curse 'im! But I'm goin' to make a clean
      breast of it all, I am, so help me Gawd. 'E made me give the young lady
      and the girl the drugged coffee, 'e did, curse 'im! I'll put you away
      before I die, you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank back with a moan of agony and bloodstained lips as Chard, with
      clenched hands and set teeth, glared at him savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence ensued as Harvey picked up a loaded Winchester, and covered
      the supercargo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You infernal scoundrel!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is hard for me to resist sending a
      bullet through you. But I hope to see you hanged for murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll answer to me for this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Chard, when Oliver
      again interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no time for quarrelling. Once more, Captain Hendry&mdash;what are
      your orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hendry consulted with Chard in low tones, then desired first of all that
      the wounded native should be taken into Oliver's boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate obeyed under protest. &ldquo;I already have a badly injured man in my
      boat, sir; and that native cannot possibly live many hours longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hendry made no answer, but gave the officer one of his shifty, sullen
      glances as the dying man was lifted out and put into Oliver's boat. Then
      he asked Oliver if the ship's papers, chronometer, charts, and his
      (Hendry's) nautical instruments had been saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; and all that he had asked for was passed over to him by
      Harvey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you save any firearms?&rdquo; was Hendry's next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Harvey; &ldquo;two Winchesters, a Snider carbine, and all the
      cartridges we could find in your cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them to me, then,&rdquo; said Hendry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvey passed them over to the captain, together with some hundreds of
      cartridges tied up in a handkerchief. Hendry and Chard took them with
      ill-concealed satisfaction, little knowing that Harvey had carefully
      hidden away the remainder of the firearms in Atkins's boat, and therefore
      did not much mind obeying Hendry's demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Hendry next spoke he did so in a sullenly, authoritative manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Remington, you and your servant must come into my boat. Mr.
      Morrison, you and the second engineer can take their places in the mate's
      boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two engineers at once, at a meaning glance from Oliver, stepped out of
      the captain's boat, and took their seats in that of the mate. Neither
      Tessa nor Maoni moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste, please, Miss Remington,&rdquo; said Hendry, not looking at her as
      he spoke, but straight before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to remain in Mr. Atkins's boat,&rdquo; replied Tessa decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you that you must come with me,&rdquo; said the captain, with
      subdued fury. &ldquo;Mr. Atkins has no compass, and I am responsible for your
      safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Captain Hendry,&rdquo; was the mocking reply, &ldquo;I relieve you of all
      responsibility for my safety. And I absolutely refuse to leave Mr. Atkins,
      except to go with Mr. Oliver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Hendry was unable to speak through passion, for he had
      determined that Tessa should come with them. Then he addressed the second
      mate. &ldquo;Mr. Atkins, I order you to come alongside and put Miss Remington
      and that native girl into my boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go to hell, you Dutch hog!&rdquo; was the laconic rejoinder from
      Atkins, as he leant upon his steer-oar and surveyed the captain and Chard
      with an air of studied insolence. &ldquo;I'll take no orders from a swab like
      you. If Miss Remington wants to stay in my boat she <i>shall</i> stay.&rdquo;
       Then turning to Tessa he said so loudly that both Chard and captain could
      hear, &ldquo;Never fear, miss; compass or no compass, you are safer with us than
      with those two.&rdquo; And as Tessa looked up into his face and smiled her
      thanks to the sturdy young officer, Chard ground his teeth with rage,
      though he tried to look unconcerned and indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use, Louis,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;we can do nothing now; time enough
      later on. Give your orders, and don't look so infernally white about the
      gills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The taunt went home, and Hendry pulled himself together. The violence with
      which he had been thrown down upon the deck the previous evening by the
      angered mate, and his present passion combined had certainly, as Chard
      said, made him look white about the gills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Miss Remington,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you refuse to come with me I
      cannot help it. Mr. Oliver, is your boat compass all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the curt answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then our course is north-north-west for Ponapé. You, Mr. Atkins, as you
      have no compass, had better keep close to me, as if we get a squally night
      with heavy rain, which is very likely, we may lose sight of each other.
      You, Mr. Oliver, can use your own judgment. We are now five hundred miles
      from Ponape.&rdquo; Then, true seaman as he was, for all his villainy, he
      ascertained what provisions were in Atkins's boat, told him to put half
      into Oliver's, and also overhauled what was in his own. There was an ample
      supply for two or three weeks, and of water there were two breakers, one
      in his own the other in the second mate's boat. That which had been in the
      mate's boat had been lost when she was rushed by the firemen, and had hung
      stern down by the for'ard fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see that Mr. Oliver's boat has all the water she wants to-day,&rdquo; said
      Atkins. &ldquo;She won't want any to-night. We'll get more than we shall like.
      It'll rain like forty thousand cats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hendry nodded a sullen assent to this, and turned to take the steer-oar
      from Huka, who, with the other native seamen, had been listening to the
      discussion between the captain and his officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huka gave up the oar, and then telling the other natives in their own
      tongue to follow him, quietly slipped overboard, and swam towards the
      second mate's boat. They leapt after him instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hendry whipped up one of the Winchesters, and was about to stand up and
      fire at the swimming men when Chard tore the carbine from his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them go, you blarsted fool! Let them go! It will be all the better
      for us,&rdquo; he said with savage earnestness, but speaking low so that the two
      firemen could not overhear him; &ldquo;we can send the whole lot of them to hell
      together before we get to Ponapé. Sit down, you blithering Dutch idiot,
      and let them go! They are playing into our hands,&rdquo; and then he whispered
      something in the captain's ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hendry looked into the supercargo's face with half-terrified, half-savage
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm with you, Sam. Better that than be hanged for shooting a couple of
      niggers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, Louis. Now make a protest to Oliver and Atkins, and ask them to
      send those three natives back. They won't do it, of course, but be quick
      about it. Say that you have only the two firemen and myself&mdash;who are
      not seamen&mdash;to help you to take the boat to Ponape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hendry took his cue quickly enough, and hailed the two other boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Oliver, and you, Mr. Atkins. My crew have deserted me. I do not want
      to resort to force to make them return, but call upon you to come
      alongside, and put those three men back into my boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver made no answer for the moment. He, Harvey, Atkins, and Huka talked
      earnestly together for a few minutes, and then the mate stood up and
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The native crew refuse to obey your orders Captain Hendry. They accuse
      you and Mr. Chard of murdering three of their shipmates. And I, and every
      one in these two boats, know that you and Mr. Chard <i>did</i> murder
      them, and I'm not going to make these three men return to you. You have a
      good boat, with mast, mainsail and jib, and more provisions than either
      the second mate or myself. We have, in this boat of mine, only six canoe
      paddles and no sail; the second mate has oars, but no sail. You could
      reach Ponape long before we do if you want to leave us in the lurch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we'll be damned glad to be quit of your company,&rdquo; shouted Atkins.
      &ldquo;Hoist your sail, you goat-faced, sneaking Schneider, and get along! When
      we are ashore at Ponapé I'll take it out of <i>you</i> captain, and Mr.
      Carr will settle up differences with <i>you</i> Mr. Chard&mdash;you
      black-faced scoundrel! And, please God, you'll both swing in Fiji after we
      have done with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hendry made no answer to the second mate's remarks, which were accompanied
      by a considerable number of oaths and much vigorous blasphemy; for the
      honest-hearted Atkins detested both his captain and the supercargo most
      fervently, as a pair of thoroughpaced villains.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for very particular reasons Captain Hendry and Mr. Samuel Chard did
      not wish to part company with the other two boats, and therefore Atkins's
      gibes and threats were passed over in silence, and Oliver acceded to
      Hendry's request to let him tow his boat, as with the gentle breeze, and
      with the six canoe paddles helping her along, the two could travel quite
      as fast as the second mate with his six oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so with a glorious sky of blue above, and over a now smooth and placid
      sea, just beginning to ripple under the breath of a gentle breeze, the
      boat voyage began.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      All that day the three boats made excellent progress, for though the wind
      was but light, the sea was very smooth, and a strong northerly current
      helped them materially.
    </p>
    <p>
      As night approached heavy white clouds appeared on the eastern horizon&mdash;the
      precursors of a series of heavy rain squalls, which in those latitudes,
      and at that season of the year&mdash;November to March&mdash;are met with
      almost nightly, especially in the vicinity of the low-lying islands of the
      Marshall and Caroline Groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the sun set, the plan of murder that was in the hearts of the
      captain and supercargo began to work. During the day they had been unable
      to converse freely, for fear of being overheard by the two firemen, but
      now the time had come for them to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the boats' lockers Harvey and Latour had placed a two gallon
      wicker-covered jar of rum, and presently Hendry hailed Oliver, whose boat
      was still towing astern. It was the first time that he had taken any
      notice of the occupants of the other boats since the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can give your men some grog if you like, Mr. Oliver,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
      you might as well hail the second mate, and tell him to do the same. I
      shall have to cast you off presently, as the first rain squall will be
      down on us, and each boat will have to take care of herself. We are bound
      to part company until the morning, but I rely on you and the second mate
      to keep head to wind during the squalls, and stick to the course I have
      given you between times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chard took out the rum and filled a half-pint pannikin to the brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, boys,&rdquo; said he pleasantly to the two firemen, who looked
      gloatingly at the liquor; &ldquo;this will warm you up for the drenching you
      will get presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unsuspecting, unfortunate men drank it off eagerly without troubling
      to add water, and then Chard, who feared that Hendry sober would be too
      great a coward for the murderous work that was to follow, poured out a
      stiff dose into another pannikin, and passed it to him. Then he took some
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass along that pannikin, boys,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you might as well have a
      skinful while you are about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men obeyed the treacherous scoundrel with alacrity. Like their
      shipmates who had perished the previous night, they were thoroughly
      intemperate men, and were only too delighted to be able to get drunk so
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filling their pannikin, which held a pint, to the brim, Chard poured half
      of it into his own empty tin, and then passed them both to the men. They
      sat down together on the bottom boards amidships, and then raised the
      pannikins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's good luck to you, Mr. Chard, and you, skipper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck, men,&rdquo; replied Hendry, watching them keenly as they swallowed
      mouthful after mouthful of the fiery stuff, which from its strength was
      known to the crew of the <i>Motutapu</i> as &ldquo;hell boiled down to a small
      half-pint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes passed, and then as the darkness encompassed the three boats,
      a sudden puff of wind came from the eastward. Hendry hailed the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a squall coming, Mr. Oliver; haul in your painter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cast off the tow line, and Chard lowered the mainsail and jib, the two
      firemen taking not the slightest notice as they continued to swallow the
      rum.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another five minutes the white wall of the hissing rain squall was upon
      them, and everything was hidden from view. Hendry swung his boat's head
      round, and let her drive before it. The other boats, he knew, would keep
      head on to the squall, and in half an hour he would be a couple of miles
      away from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain's boat drove steadily before the rushing wind, and the
      stinging, torrential rain soon covered the bottom boards with half a foot
      of water. Chard took the bailer, and began to bail out, taking no heed of
      the firemen, who were lying in the water in a drunken stupor, overcome by
      the rum.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the rain ceased, and the sky cleared as if by magic, though but
      few stars were visible. Chard went on bailing steadily. Presently he rose,
      came aft, took a seat beside Hendry and looked stealthily into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; muttered the captain inquiringly, as if he were afraid that the
      two poor wretches who but a few feet away lay like dead men might awaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment Chard made no answer, but putting out his hand he gripped
      Hendry by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear what Carr and Atkins said?&rdquo; he asked in a fierce whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hendry's sullen eyes gleamed vindictively as he nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they mean it&mdash;if we are fools enough to give them the chance
      of doing it. And by God, Louis, I tell you that it means hanging for us
      both; if not hanging, imprisonment for life in Darlinghurst Gaol. We shot
      the niggers, right enough, and every man of the crew of the <i>Motutapu</i>,
      from Oliver down to Carr's servant, will go dead against us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment. &ldquo;This has happened at a bad time for us, Louis. Two
      years ago Thorne, the skipper of the <i>Trustful</i>, labour schooner, his
      mate, second mate, boatswain and four hands were cast for death for firing
      into native canoes in the New Hebrides. And although none of them were
      hanged they are rotting in prison now, and will die in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; answered the captain in a whisper. &ldquo;Thorne was reprieved and got
      a life-sentence, the other chaps got twenty-one years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you, Louis, that if you and I face a jury we shall stand a
      worse chance than Jim Thorne and his crowd did. The whole crew will go
      dead against us, and swear there was no attempt to mutiny&mdash;that girl
      and her servant too, and Jessop as well. Jessop would give us away in any
      case over the cause of the fire, if he said nothing else. It's their lives
      or ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it to be?&rdquo; muttered Hendry, drawing the steer oar inboard, and
      putting his eager, cruel eyes close to Chard's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what it must be. You and I, Louis, will be <i>'the only survivors
      of the &ldquo;Motutapu&rdquo; which took fire at sea. All hands escaped in the three
      boats, but only the captain's boat, containing himself and the supercargo,
      succeeded in reaching Ponapé after terrible hardships. The mate's and
      second mate's boats, with all their occupants, have undoubtedly been lost.</i>'
      That is what the newspapers will say, Louis, and it will be quite true, as
      all those in the other boats will perish. By sunrise tomorrow none of the
      ship's company but you and I must be alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are we going to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till nearly daylight, and then we can get within range of them, and
      pick them off one by one, if there is a good breeze. If there is no wind
      and we cannot keep going, we must put it off for the time. There's two
      hundred and thirty Winchester and Snider cartridges in that handkerchief&mdash;I've
      counted them&mdash;and we can make short work of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about these fellows?&rdquo; said Hendry, inclining his head towards the
      drunken firemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They go first. They must go overboard in the next squall, which will be
      upon us in a few minutes. Take another drink, Louis, and don't shake so,
      or&mdash;&rdquo; and Chard grasped Hendry by the collar and spoke with sudden
      fury&mdash;&ldquo;or by God, I'll settle <i>you</i> first, and do the whole
      thing myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it, Sam; I'll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the hissing rain and the hum of the squall was upon them as the
      ocean was blotted out from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Chard&mdash;&ldquo;quick.&rdquo; They sprang forward together, lifted the
      unconscious men one by one, and threw them over the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run up the jib,&rdquo; said Hendry hoarsely; &ldquo;let us get further away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rotten-hearted Dutch cur,&rdquo; and Chard seized the captain by the beard
      with his left hand and clenched his right threateningly, &ldquo;brace yourself
      up, or I'll ring your neck like a fowl's, and send you overboard after
      them. Think of your wife and family&mdash;and of the hangman's noose
      dangling between you and them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Throughout the night the rain squalls swept the ocean at almost hourly
      intervals, with more or less violence, but were never of long enough
      duration to raise more than a short, lumpy sea, which quickly subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      About an hour before dawn, however, a more than usually heavy bank formed
      to windward, and Harvey, with Huka and the other natives, could see that
      there was more wind in it than would be safe for the mate's boat, which
      was deep in the water, owing to the number of people in her. Oliver agreed
      with them that they should tranship three or four of their number into the
      second mate's boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better be sure than sorry, Carr,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;can any one of you see Mr.
      Atkin's boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be seen or heard of her until a boat lantern was hoisted on
      an oar by Oliver, and a few seconds after was responded to by Atkins
      soaking a piece of woollen cloth in rum, wrapping it round the point of a
      boathook, and setting it alight. Its flash revealed him half a mile away
      to leeward. Hendry and Chard, who by this time were quite three miles
      distant, saw the blazing light, and the latter wondered what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have parted company, I think,&rdquo; said Hendry, &ldquo;and as the mate's boat
      is too deep I daresay he wants Atkins to take some of his people before
      this big squall comes down. It's going to be an ugly fellow this, and
      we'll have to drive again. I wish it would swamp 'em both. The sharks
      would save us a lot of trouble then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As quickly as possible Oliver paddled down to Atkins, and Harvey, Latour,
      Huka, and another native got into the second mate's boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to run before this, Atkins,&rdquo; said the mate, alluding to the
      approaching squall; &ldquo;it will last a couple of hours or more by the look of
      it. Are you very wet, Miss Remington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, Mr. Oliver,&rdquo; answered the girl, with a laugh; &ldquo;but I don't mind it
      a bit, as the rain is not cold. I am too old a 'sailor man' to mind a
      wetting. Are you all quite well? I can't see your face, Mr. Studdert, nor
      yours, Mr. Morrison, it is so dark. Oh, Mr. Studdert, I wish I had one of
      your cigarettes to smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had one to give you, miss,&rdquo; answered the pale-faced young
      engineer. &ldquo;A pipe is no to my liking, but I fear me I'll have to tackle
      one in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas, poor Studdert, little did he know that the morning, now so near, was
      to be his last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye for the present, Miss Remington,&rdquo; called out Oliver as the boats
      again separated. &ldquo;Take good care of her, Harvey, and of yoursels too.
      He'll be getting an attack of the shakes in the morning, miss, after all
      this wetting. Give him plenty of rum, my dear, whether he likes it or not.
      You're a plucky little lady, and next to having you in my own boat I am
      glad to see you with Atkins. Cheer up, lads, one and all; we'll have the
      sun out in another hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later both boats were driving before the fury of the squall,
      and the crews had to keep constantly bailing, for this time the violence
      of the wind was such that, despite the most careful steering of the two
      officers, large bodies of water came over amidships, and threatened to
      swamp the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dawn came the sky was again as clear as it had been on the previous
      morning, and Atkins stood up and looked for the captain's and mate's
      boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they are, Harvey,&rdquo; and he pointed to the westward; &ldquo;the skipper is
      under sail, and making back towards Oliver. Well, that's one thing about
      him, dog as he is&mdash;he's a thorough sailor man, and is standing back
      to take Oliver in tow again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this time the captain's boat was about three miles distant from that of
      the second mate, and Oliver's between the two, but much nearer to Hendry
      and Chard's than to Atkins's. She was under both mainsail and jib, and as
      the sea was again very smooth was slipping through the water very quickly
      under a now steady breeze, as she stood towards the mate's boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the red sun burst from the ocean Atkins told the crew to cease pulling
      for a few minutes and get something to eat. The men were all in good
      humour, though they yet meant to wreak their vengeance on Chard and Hendry
      for the murder of their shipmates. The wounded man who had been put in
      Oliver's boat they knew had also died, and this had still further inflamed
      them. But for the present they said nothing, but ate their biscuit and
      tinned beef in cheerful silence, after waiting for Tessa and Maoni to
      begin. Huka, their recognised leader, and Malua, Harvey's servant, had
      both assured them that the captain and Chard would be brought to
      punishment, but this assurance was not satisfactory to the majority of
      them. One of them, the big Manhikian who had helped Latour to rescue Tessa
      and Maoni from their cabin, was a brother of the man who had just died
      from his wounds in Oliver's boat, and he had, during the night, promised
      his shipmates to take his own and give them their <i>utu</i> (revenge)
      before the boats reached Ponapé.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn to again, boys,&rdquo; said Atkins presently, as soon as the men had
      satisfied their hunger; &ldquo;we must catch up to the others now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The natives bent to their oars again, and sent the boat along at a great
      rate, when suddenly Harvey heard the sound of firearms. He stood up and
      looked ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;look there, Atkins! The captain and Chard are
      firing into Oliver's boat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke the repeated crackling of Winchester rifles could be
      heard, and the mate's boat seemed to be in great confusion, and her
      occupants were paddling away from their assailants, who, however, were
      following them up closely at a distance of about fifty yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull, men, pull! For God's sake, lay into it! The captain and firemen are
      murdering Mr. Oliver and his party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The seamen uttered a shout of rage, and made the boat leap through the
      water as now, in addition to the sharp crackle of the Winchesters, they
      heard the heavier report of a Snider, and Harvey, jumping up on the after
      whaleback, and steadying himself with one hand on Atkins's shoulder, saw
      that only two or three of Oliver's crew were now paddling&mdash;the rest
      had been shot down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll never get there in time, Atkins,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;unless we can hit
      those who are firing. It's Chard and the skipper! Let Huka steer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few seconds the change was effected. Huka took the steer-oar, two of
      the after-oars were double-banked, and Atkins and Harvey sprang forward
      with their Sniders, and began firing at the captain's boat, though at a
      range which gave them little chance of hitting her. Every moment, however,
      the distance was decreasing, and the two men fired steadily and carefully.
      But the Winchesters still cracked for another five minutes. Then the fire
      from the captain's boat ceased as a shot from Atkins's rifle smashed into
      her amidships. She was suddenly put before the wind, and then Chard came
      aft, and began firing at the approaching boat with his Snider, in the hope
      of disabling her, so that he and his fellow-murderer (now that their plan
      of utterly destroying all the occupants of both boats had been so
      unexpectedly frustrated) might escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the work of slaughter in which he had just been engaged and the
      rolling of the boat, together with the continuous hum of bullets overhead,
      made his aim wild, and neither the second mate's boat nor any of its
      people were hit, and she swept along to the rescue.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      An exclamation of horror burst from Harvey as the boat, with its panting
      crew, dashed up alongside that of the chief mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, Tessa, do not look!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the half-sunken boat was a shambles, and of her nine occupants only
      three were alive&mdash;the second steward Jessop, Morrison, and Oliver
      himself. The latter lay in the stern sheets with a bullet hole through his
      chest, and a smashed hip; he had but just time to raise his hand in mute
      farewell to Harvey and Atkins, and then breathed his last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrison, whose spine was broken by a Winchester bullet, but who was
      perfectly conscious, was at once lifted out and placed in Atkins's boat,
      and Tessa, with the tears streaming down her pale face, and trying hard to
      restrain her sobs, pillowed his old, grey head upon Atkins's coat. Then
      Jessop, who was evidently still in agony from his broken ribs, one of
      which, so Morrison said in a faint voice, had, he thought, been driven
      into his lungs, was placed beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Studdert and the five native seamen were dead, some of them having
      received as many as five or six bullet wounds. Studdert himself had been
      shot through the head, and lay for'ard with his pale face upturned to the
      sky, and his eyes closed as if in a peaceful sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat had been pierced in several places below the water-line by Snider
      bullets, and by the time Morrison and Jessop had been removed, and Harvey
      and Atkins had satisfied themselves that the other seven men in her were
      dead, she was nearly full of water&mdash;not the clear, bright water of
      the ocean alone, but water deeply stained with the blood of the murdered
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must cast off,&rdquo; said Atkins in a low voice, &ldquo;we can do no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke a bullet from Chard's Snider struck the water about thirty
      yards away, and springing up, he seized his own rifle again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huka placed his hand on the officer's arm, and then turned to Harvey and
      spoke in Samoan, gravely and with solemn emphasis, though his brown cheeks
      were wetted with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us take no heed of the bullets that come. Here be six dead men whose
      souls have gone to God for judgment. Let us pray for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atkins, his blazing eyes fixed on the captain's boat, from which every few
      seconds a bullet came humming overhead, or striking the water within a few
      yards, laid down the rifle and took off his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead, Huka. You're a better Christian than me. Sling out a prayer for
      these poor chaps as quick as you can. We can't bury them in a decent,
      shipshape fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two men stepped into the sinking, shot-torn boat, and then Huka stood up
      amidships among his comrades, with bowed head, and his hands crossed upon
      his great naked chest. He prayed in Samoan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>O Jehovah, who holdeth the great sea in the hollow of Thy hand, we
      commit to its depths these the bodies of our shipmates who have been
      slain. O Father', most just and most merciful, let them become of Thy
      kingdom. Amen</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, one by one, the bodies of Studdert and of the five natives were
      dropped overboard by the two seamen as reverently as circumstances
      permitted, and in silence broken only by the suppressed sobbing of the two
      girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such stores as were in poor Oliver's boat were next taken out, and then
      the wrecked and bloodstained craft was cast adrift and left to fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the second mate grasped the haft of the steer-oar again another shot
      from the captain's boat fell some distance ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's running away from us as fast as he can,&rdquo; said Harvey; &ldquo;look, he's
      hauled up a couple of points!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, so he has. And our short Sniders won't carry any further than the one
      he's firing with, so we have no chance of hitting him, I'm afraid.
      However, just let us try. How many Sniders have we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avast pulling, lads. We'll give him a parting shot together. Maybe we
      might drop a bullet into him. Get out the other five Sniders, Harvey; the
      Winchesters are no use at such a range.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat was swung broadside on, and the two white men and five natives
      fired a volley together. Tessa stood up on the after-thwart, and watched
      through Atkin's glasses; the heavy bullets all fell short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, lads,&rdquo; said Atkins. &ldquo;God Almighty ain't going to let those
      two men escape. Now, Harvey, what about ourselves? What is it to be?
      Ponape, or the nearest land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nearest land, tor Gawd's sake,&rdquo; sobbed Jessop. &ldquo;I ain't got long to
      live, and for Christ's sake don't chuck me overboard to be chawed up by
      the sharks like a piece o' dead meat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said a faint voice beside him, &ldquo;ye're ower particular, I'm
      thinking. And it would be a verra hungry shark that wad hae the indecency
      to eat such a puir chicken-hearted creature as yourself, ye miserable cur!
      Are ye no ashamed to be whining before the two lasses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the dying Morrison who spoke. Tessa bent over him. &ldquo;Do not be angry
      with him,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;he is in great agony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I hae no doubt he's in verra great pain; but ye see, my dear, I'm
      auld and crotchety, and the creature's verra annoying wi' his whining and
      moaning and fearsome blasphemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tessa, who knew as well as the brave old man knew himself that he was
      dying, placed her soft hand on his rugged brow in silent sympathy; he
      looked up at her with a cheerful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvey and Atkins consulted. Ponapé was between four and five hundred
      miles distant, a long voyage for a deeply-laden boat without a sail. Two
      hundred miles to the westward was Pikirami Atoll (the &ldquo;Greenwich Island&rdquo;
       of the charts), and a hundred and eighty miles north of that was Nukuor,
      the most southerly of the vast archipelago of the Caroline Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what is best for us to do, Atkins,&rdquo; said the trader. &ldquo;At
      this time of the year we can count upon every night being such as it was
      last night, perhaps a great deal worse; and we must either turn tail to
      the squalls or put out a sea anchor and drift. This means that we'll make
      no headway at all at night time, and be set steadily to the westward, and
      out of our course for Ponapé. If we had a sail it would be right enough,
      as we could lay up for there&mdash;within a couple of points anyway. But
      we have no sail, and willing as the men are to pull, it will be terribly
      exhausting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atkins nodded. &ldquo;Just so, Mr. Carr. If, as you say, we had a sail it would
      be different. Without one it may take us a fortnight or more to get to
      Ponapé.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. Now on the other hand, Pikirami Lagoon lies less than a hundred
      and fifty miles dead to leeward of us. It is low, but I don't think we
      shall miss it if we steer W. by S., as on the south end there is a coral
      mound about a hundred feet high. If we do miss it we can steer south for
      New Ireland; we can't miss <i>that</i> if we tried to, and would get there
      sooner than we could reach Ponapé. Then there is another advantage in our
      making for Pikirami&mdash;we can run before the night squalls, and the
      harder they blow the better it will be for us&mdash;we'll get there all
      the sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Harvey went on to say that at Piki-rami&mdash;which he knew well&mdash;they
      would meet with a friendly reception from the few natives who inhabited
      two islets out of the thirty which formed the atoll. Twice every year the
      place was visited by a small German trading schooner from Blanche Bay, in
      New Britain, and possibly, he thought, they might either find her there
      loading a cargo of copra; or, if not, they could wait for her. In the
      latter case he would on Tessa's behalf charter the vessel to take them all
      to Ponapé, for her father's name and credit were well known from one end
      of the Pacific to the other, and there would be no difficulty in making
      terms with the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Atkins agreed willingly to Harvey's suggestions, for he well knew the
      great risks that would attend the attempt to reach Ponapé under such
      circumstances as were theirs; and the native crew, much as they wished to
      pursue the captain and wreak their vengeance upon him and the supercargo,
      readily acquiesced in Harvey's plan of steering for Pikirami Lagoon in
      when he pointed out to them the difficulties and dangers that lay before
      them by making for Ponapé, or, indeed, any other island of the Caroline
      Group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those men there,&rdquo; said Harvey, speaking in Samoan, and pointing to
      the captain's boat, which was now more than a mile distant, &ldquo;cannot escape
      punishment for their crimes; for is not this the word of God: 'Thou shalt
      do no murder'? And those two men have done murder, and God will call them
      to account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roka, the big Manhikian native, whose brother had been killed, answered
      for himself and his comrades in the same tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that is true. But yet it is hard that I, whose brother's blood is
      before my eyes and the smell of it in my nostrils, cannot see these men
      die. How can we tell, master, that men will judge them for their crimes?
      They are sailing away, and may reach some country far distant, and so be
      safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey partly assented. &ldquo;They may escape for a time, Roka, but not for
      long. Rest assured of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a tot of rum was served out to each man, and the boat's head put W.
      by S. for Pikirami Lagoon, while Tessa and Maoni set to work under
      Atkins's directions to sew together some odd pieces of calico and navy
      blue print, which Latour the steward had fortunately thrust into the sack
      containing the firearms. When it was completed it made a fairly sized
      squaresail, which could always be used during light winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain's boat had disappeared from view, when Jessop the second
      steward beckoned to Harvey to come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the young lady to go for'ard, mister, will you?&rdquo; he said, turning his
      haggard eyes upon the trader's face. &ldquo;I feel as 'ow I'm goin', an' I said
      I would make a clean breast of it. But I don't want 'er to 'ear; do ye
      twig, mister, though I'll tell you and Mr. Hatkins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey nodded, and whispered to Tessa to go for'ard. &ldquo;The poor little
      beggar is dying, Tessa, and has something to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tessa and Maoni went for'ard and sat down under the shade of the
      newly-made mainsail, which was hoisted upon an oar with a bamboo yard.
      There they were quite out of hearing of the vile confession of Jessop's
      complicity with Chard and the captain made by the wretched man, who was
      now sinking fast, and knew that his hours were numbered, for, as Morrison
      had surmised, one of his lungs was fatally injured. And when he had
      finished the low-spoken tale of his villainy even the rough-natured Atkins
      was filled with pity when he saw how the poor wretch was suffering, both
      physically and mentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've done right, Jessop, in telling us this; it'll be all the better
      for you when you have to stand before the Almighty, won't it, Mr. Carr?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, Jessop,&rdquo; said Harvey kindly; &ldquo;and I wish we could do
      something to alleviate your pain, poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, sir. You're a gent if ever there was one, and you 'as taken
      away a lot o' the pain I've 'ad in me 'eart by forgivin' me. And perhaps
      the young lady will just let me tell 'er I'm sorry, and give me 'er 'and
      before I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atkins beckoned to Tessa, who came quickly aft and knelt beside the dying
      man, who looked into her soft, sympathetic face longingly yet fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a bad lot, miss, as Mr. Carr will tell you when I'm dead. It was me
      that give you and Monny the drugged coffee, and I want you to forgive me,
      an' give me your 'and.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tessa looked wonderingly at Harvey, who bent towards her and whispered a
      few words. In an instant she took Jessop's hand between both of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jessop,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;I forgive you freely, and I do hope you
      will get better soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with dimmed, wistful eyes. &ldquo;Thank you, miss. You're very
      kind to a cove like me. Will you 'old me 'and a bit longer, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Early in the afternoon, as the boat slipped lazily over the gentle ocean
      swell, he died. And though Atkins and Harvey would have liked to have
      acceded to his last wishes to be buried on shore, stern necessity forbade
      them so doing, for they knew not how long it would be ere they reached
      Pikirami; and so at sunset his body was consigned to the deep.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      For the rest of that day, and during the night, when the white rain
      squalls came with a droning, angry hum from the eastward and drenched the
      people with a furious downpour, flattening the heaving swell with its
      weight, the boat kept steadily on her course; and, but for the shadow of
      death which hourly grew darker over poor Morrison, the voyagers would have
      talked and laughed and made light of their sodden and miserable
      surroundings. Morrison himself was the most cheerful man in the boat, and
      when Atkins and Harvey rigged an oilskin coat over him to keep the rain
      from his face at least he protested as vigorously as he could, saying that
      he did not mind the rain a bit, and urging them to use it to protect &ldquo;the
      two lassies&rdquo; from the blinding and deafening downpour.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Dawn at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The misty sea haze lifted and scattered before the first breath of the
      gentle breeze, a blood-red sun leapt from the shimmering water-line to
      windward; a frigate bird and his mate swept swiftly through the air from
      the westward to view the dark spot upon the ocean two thousand feet below,
      and day had come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tessa had the engineer's old, grey head pillowed on her lap. Harvey held
      his right hand, and Atkins, who knew that the end was near, had taken off
      his soddened cap, and bent his face low over the haft of the steer-oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel any pain, Mr. Morrison?&rdquo; asked Tessa, as she stroked the old
      man's face, and tried to hide her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wouldna be for saying no, and I wouldna be for saying yes, my
      dearie,&rdquo; replied the brave old fellow; &ldquo;I'm no complaining aboot mysel',
      but I'd like to see ye 'saft and warm,' as we Scots say, instead of
      sitting here wi' my auld, greasy head in your lap, and your ain puir body
      shivering wi' cauld. Gie me your hand, Harvey Carr... and yours too, Miss
      Remington.... May God guide ye both together; and you too, Atkins, for ye
      are a guid sailor man, and a honest one, too. And if ye can get to this
      lagoon in time&mdash;ye know what I mean&mdash;ye'll pit my auld bones
      under God's earth and no cast me overboard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atkins was beside him in a moment. &ldquo;Brace up, Morrison, old man, you're a
      long way off dead yet,&rdquo; he said, with rough sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Atkins, I'm verra near... verra near. But I hae no fear. I'm no
      afraid of what is to come; because I hae a clean sheet o' my life to show
      to the Almighty&mdash;I'm no like that puir devil Jessop. Harvey man,
      listen to me. Long, long ago, when I was a bairn at my mother's knee, I
      read a vairse of poetry which has never come to my mind till now, when I'm
      verra near my Maker, I canna repeat the exact words, but I think it goes
      like this,&rdquo; he whispered,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;'He who, from zone to zone,
         Guides o'er the trackless main the sea-bird's flight,
      In the long way that I must tread alone
         Will guide my steps aright.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God guide us all as He guides the sea-bird, and as He has guided
      you,&rdquo; said Tessa sobbingly, as she pressed her lips to his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morrison took her hand and held it tightly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help and bless ye, lassie. May ye and Harvey never see the shadow of
      a sorrow in your lives. Atkins, ye'll tak' guid care to remember that
      there is a hundred and sixty-three pounds due to me frae Hillingdon and
      MacFreeland, and that if ye do not care to take it yoursel', it must go to
      auld John Cameron, the sailors' parson in Sydney. Ye hae ony amount of
      witnesses to hear what I'm now telling ye. I'm no for being long wi' ye,
      and I dinna want yoursel' nor auld Jock Cameron to be robbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see that the old parson gets it, Morrison,&rdquo; said Atkins huskily;
      &ldquo;he'll do more good with it than a man like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; said the old engineer, as he lifted his kindly grey eyes to the
      second mate, &ldquo;ye're welcome to it. I wish it were a thousand, for ye're a
      grand sailor man, wi' a big heart, and maybe ye hae some good woman
      waiting for ye; and a hunner and sixty pound is no sma' help to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice failed, but his lips were smiling still as he gave his last
      sigh; and then his head lay still in Tessa's arms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      All that day over a gently heaving sea the boat sped steadily onward
      before the soft breath of the dying trade wind, and when night fell Harvey
      and Atkins reckoned that they could not be more than twenty miles from
      Pikirami. About midnight, therefore, the sail was lowered, and the boat
      allowed to drift, as otherwise she might have run past the island in the
      darkness. Two of the natives were placed on the look-out for indications
      of the land, and the rest of the people, except Harvey, laid down and
      slept, for after one or two rain squalls early in the evening the night
      had turned out fine and dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Morrison's body had been covered up and placed under the for'ard
      thwarts; amidships lay Atkins, who had fallen asleep with his pipe in his
      mouth and his head pillowed on the naked chest of one of the native
      sailors; aft, in the stern sheets, Tessa and Maoni slept with their arms
      around each other, Tessa's pale cheek lying upon the soft, rounded bosom
      of the native girl. Still further aft, on the whale-back, Harvey sat,
      cross-legged, contentedly smoking a stumpy clay pipe lent to him by Huka,
      and looking, now at the glorious, myriad-starred sky above, and now at the
      beautiful face just beneath him, and musing upon the events of the past
      few days. Then as his eye rested for a moment or two on the stiffened form
      of the dead engineer, his face hardened, and he thought of Chard and the
      captain. Where were they now? Making for Ponapé, no doubt, with all
      possible speed, so that they might escape in some passing whale-ship or
      vessel bound China-wards. But where could they go? What civilised country
      would afford protection to such fiendish and cruel murderers? Neither of
      them dare dream of ever putting foot on Australian soil again if a single
      one of the survivors of the <i>Motutapu</i> reached there before them.
      Then he thought of Hendry's wife and three fair daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor things,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;the story of their father's crime will break
      their hearts, and make life desolate to them. Better for them if the
      Almighty, in His mercy, took them before this frightful tale is told to
      wreck their lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed, and then Roka, who was one of the look-outs, came aft,
      stepping softly so as not to awaken the sleepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Roka?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; whispered the native, &ldquo;dost hear the call of the <i>kanapu</i>?
      There be many of them about us in the air; so this land of Pikirami must
      be near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey nodded and listened, and though his ear was not so quick as that of
      the sailor, he soon caught the low, hoarse notes of the <i>kanapu</i>, a
      large bird of the booby species, which among the islands of the North-West
      Pacific fishes at night-time and sleeps most of the day; its principal
      food being flying-fish and <i>atulti</i> or young bonito, which, always
      swimming on the surface, fall an easy prey to the keen-eyed, sharp,
      blue-beaked bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Roka,&rdquo; said the trader, &ldquo;we be near the land, for the <i>kanapu</i>
      never wandereth far from the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low as he spoke, Tessa heard him, for she slumbered but lightly. She rose
      and sat up, deftly winding her loosened hair about her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it land, Harvey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land is near, Tessa. We can hear the <i>kanapu</i> calling to each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad, Harvey; for it would be terribly hard upon the men if we
      missed Pikirami and had to make for New Britain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it would indeed. So far we have been very lucky, however, yet, even
      if we had missed it, we should have no cause to fear. We have a fine boat,
      provisions and water, a good crew, and one of the best sailor men that
      ever trod a deck in command,&rdquo; and he pointed to the sleeping second mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then as they sat together, listening to the cries of the sea-birds, and
      waiting for the dawn, Harvey re-told to Tessa, for Roka's benefit, the
      story of that dreadful boat voyage sixteen years before, in which his
      father and five others had perished from hunger and thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was but fourteen years of age then, and people wondered how a boy like
      me survived when strong men had died. They did not know that every one of
      those thirteen men, unasked by my father, had put aside some portion of
      their miserable allowance for me, and I, God forgive me for doing so, took
      it. One man, a big Norwegian, was so fearful of going mad with the agonies
      of thirst, that he knelt down and offered up a prayer, then he shook hands
      with us all&mdash;my father was already dead&mdash;and jumped overboard.
      We were all too weak to try and save him. And less than an hour afterwards
      God's rain came, as my father had said it would come just before he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atkins, with a last mighty snore, awoke, sat up, and filled his pipe
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, awake, miss!&rdquo; he said with rough good-humour to Tessa. &ldquo;How goes
      it, Mr. Carr?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully, old man. We're near the land; we can hear some <i>kanapu</i> about
      us, so we can't be more than five or six miles away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The land is there,&rdquo; said Roka to Harvey, pointing to a dark shadow abeam
      of the boat, &ldquo;and we could see it but for the rain-clouds which hide it
      from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey grasped the steer oar, the crew were aroused, and in another few
      minutes the boat was under way again, heading for the sombre cloud to the
      westward under which Roka said the land lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was right. For as the dawn broke there came to the listening ears
      in the boat the low hum of the surf upon the coral reef; and then, as the
      rain-cloud dissolved and vanished to leeward, a long line of coco-palms
      stood up from the sea three miles away, and the bright golden rays of the
      rising sun shone upon a beach of snow-white sand, between which and the
      curling breakers that fell upon the barrier reef there lay a belt of pale
      green water as smooth as a mountain lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up with the sail, boys,&rdquo; cried Harvey, with sparkling eyes, turning to
      Atkins as he spoke; &ldquo;the passage into the lagoon is on the south side,
      just round that high mound of coral, and the native village is on the
      first islet on this side of the passage. Keep her going, my lads; we shall
      be drinking young coconuts and stretching our legs in another half an
      hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sail was hoisted, and, with five oars assisting, the boat was kept
      away two or three points, till the entrance to the lagoon was opened out,
      and the weary voyagers saw before them a scene of quiet beauty and repose
      that filled their hearts with thankfulness. Nestling under a grove of
      coco-palms was a village of not more than a dozen thatched houses, whose
      people had but just awakened to another day of easy labour&mdash;labour
      that was never a task. As Harvey steered the boat in between the coral
      walls of the narrow passage, two or three thin columns of pale blue smoke
      ascended from the palm grove, and presently some women and children, clad
      only in their thick girdles of grass, came out from the houses and walked
      towards the beach for their morning bathe. Then the <i>click-clack</i> of
      the oars in the rowlocks made them look seaward, to utter a scream of
      astonishment at the strange sight of the crowded boat so suddenly
      appearing before them. In another ten seconds every man, woman, and child
      in the village&mdash;about fifty people all told&mdash;were clustered
      together on the beach, shouting and gesticulating in the most frantic
      excitement, some of the men rushing into the water, and calling out to the
      white men to steer clear of several submerged coral boulders which lay
      directly in the boat's track.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their astonishment was intensified when Harvey answered them in their
      own tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank ye, friends, but I have been to this land of thine many times.
      Have ye all forgotten me so soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That they had not forgotten was quickly evident, for his name was shouted
      again and again with eager, welcoming cries as the boat was run up on to
      the hard, white sand of the shining beach, and he, Atkins, Tessa, and
      their companions were literally pounced upon by the delighted people and
      carried up to the headman's house. Ten minutes later every family was busy
      preparing food for their unexpected visitors; and pigs, fowls, and ducks
      were being slaughtered throughout the islet, whilst Tessa and her faithful
      Maoni were simply overwhelmed with caresses from the women and children,
      who were anxious to hear the story of their adventures from the time of
      the burning of the steamer to the moment of their arrival in the lagoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calling the head-man apart Harvey pointed to the body of Morrison, which
      was then being carried up from the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ere we eat and drink, let us think of the dead,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kindly-hearted and sympathetic natives at once set to work to dig out
      a grave beneath a wide-spreading pandanus palm, which grew on the side of
      the coral mound overlooking the waters of the placid lagoon; whilst some
      of the women brought Atkins and Harvey clean new mats to serve as a shroud
      for their dead shipmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then mustering the hands together, Atkins, with Harvey, Roka, and Huka,
      carried the body to its last resting-place, and Huka, as Latour the
      steward dropped a handful of the sandy soil into the grave, prayed as he
      had prayed over the bodies of those who had been buried at sea&mdash;simply,
      yet touchingly&mdash;and then the party returned along the narrow
      palm-shaded path to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much to Harvey's satisfaction, the head-man informed him that a trading
      schooner was expected to reach Pikirami within two or three weeks, as
      nearly six months had passed since her last visit, and she always came
      twice a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will suit us well,&rdquo; said Harvey to Tessa and Atkins, as they sat in
      the head-man's cool, shady house and ate the food that had been brought to
      them. &ldquo;We can well wait here for two or three weeks; and the skipper of
      the <i>Sikiana</i> will be glad enough to earn five or six hundred dollars
      by giving us a passage to Ponapé. I know him very well; he's a decent
      little Dutchman named Westphalen, who has sailed so long in English and
      American ships that he's civilised. He was with me, Tessa, when I was
      sailing the <i>Belle Brandon</i> for your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after noon the crew, after having had a good rest, set to work to
      overhaul the boat in a large canoe shed, for quite possibly they might
      have to put to sea in her again, if anything should prevent the <i>Sikiana</i>
      from calling at the island in a reasonable time.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night as the second mate and his companions were sleeping peacefully
      under the thatched roofs of the little native village, with nought to
      disturb their slumbers but the gentle lapping of the waters of the lagoon
      on the sandy beach, and the ceaseless call of the reef beyond, Hendry and
      his companion in crime were sitting in their boat talking earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was steering; Chard sat on the after-thwart, facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that I don't care much what we do, Louis,&rdquo; said the
      supercargo, with a reckless laugh, as he looked into the captain's sullen
      face. &ldquo;We've made a damned mess of it, and I don't see how we are to get
      out of it by going to Ponapé.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are we to do?&rdquo; asked Hendry in a curious, husky voice, for
      Chard's mocking, careless manner filled him with a savage hatred, which
      only his fear of the man made him restrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us talk it over quietly, Louis. But take a drink first,&rdquo; and he
      handed the captain some rum-and-water. Hendry drank it in gloomy silence,
      and waited till the supercargo had taken some himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Louis, here is the position. We <i>can't</i> go to Ponapé, for
      Atkins will very likely get there as soon as we could, for with light
      winds such as we have had to-day he would soon pass us with six oars, deep
      as he is in the water. And even if we got there a week before him, we
      might not find a ship bound to Sydney or anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is a chance of finding one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, there <i>is</i> a chance. But there is also a chance of Atkins's
      boat being picked up at sea this very day, or the next, or a month hence,
      and he and his crowd reaching Sydney long before us. And <i>I</i> don't
      want to run my neck into the noose that will be waiting there. Neither do
      you, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in the name of hell do you keep on talking about <i>that?</i>&rdquo; burst
      from the captain; &ldquo;don't I know it as well as you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I won't allude to such an unpleasant possibility&mdash;I <i>should</i>
      say certainty&mdash;again,&rdquo; replied Chard coolly. &ldquo;But as I was saying,
      the chances are against us. If we kept on for Ponapé we should either be
      collared the moment we put foot ashore, or before we get away from there
      to China or any other place, for Atkins is bound to turn up there, unless,
      by a stroke of good luck for us, he meets with bad weather, and they all
      go to the bottom. That's one chance in our favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His boat is certainly very deep,&rdquo; said Hendry musingly, as he nervously
      stroked his long beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is; but then she has a kanaka crew, and I never yet heard of a
      drowned kanaka, any more than I've heard of a dead donkey. With a white
      crew she would stand to run some heavy risks in bad weather, with kanakas
      she'd keep afloat anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hendry uttered an oath, and tugged at his beard savagely. &ldquo;Go on, go on,
      then. Don't keep harping on the pros and cons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take another drink, man. Don't behave like a fretful child. Curse it all!
      To think of us being euchred so easily by Carr and Atkins! Why, they must
      have half a boat load of Winchester and Sniders, judging by the way they
      were firing.... There, drink that, Louis. Oh, if we had had but a couple
      of those long trade Sniders out of the trade-room!&rdquo; He struck his clenched
      fist upon the thwart. &ldquo;We could have kept our own distance from the second
      mate, and finished him and his crowd as easily as we did the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we didn't have them,&rdquo; said the captain gloomily; &ldquo;and if we had
      thought of getting them, we were neither of us able to stand on our feet
      after the mauling we got on board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chard drank some more rum, and went on smoking in silence for a few
      moments; then he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a wife and family and property in Sydney, and I feel sorry for
      you, Louis, by God, I do. But for you to think of going there again means
      certain death, as certain for you as it is for me. But this is what we <i>can</i>
      do. We have a good boat, and well found, and can steer for the Admiralty
      Group, where we are dead sure to meet with some of the sperm whalers. From
      there we can get a passage to Manila, and at Manila you can write to your
      wife and fix up your future. Get her to sell your house and property
      quietly, and come and join you there. I daresay,&rdquo; he laughed mockingly,
      &ldquo;she'll know by the time she gets your letter that you're not likely to go
      to Sydney to bring her. And then of course none of her and your friends
      will think it strange that she should leave Sydney, where your name and
      mine will be pretty notorious. There's two Dutch mail boats running to
      Manila from Sydney&mdash;the <i>Atjeh</i> and the <i>Generaal Pel</i>. In
      six months' time, after Atkins and Carr get to Sydney, the <i>Motutapu</i>
      affair will be forgotten, and you and your family can settle down under a
      new name in some other part of the world. That is what I mean to do,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hendry listened with the closest attention, and something like a sigh
      escaped from his over-burdened bosom. &ldquo;I suppose it's the best thing,
      Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the <i>only</i> thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain bent down and looked at the compass and thought for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About S.W. will be the course for tonight. To-morrow I can tell better
      when I get the sun and a look at the chart. Anyway, S.W. is within a point
      or less of a good course for the Admiralty Group.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wore the boat's head round, as Chard eased off the main-sheet in
      silence, and for the rest of the night they took turn and turn about at
      the steer-oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning a light breeze set in, and the whaleboat slipped over the
      sunlit sea like a snow-white bird, with the water bubbling and hissing
      under her clean-cut stem. Then Hendry examined his chart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll sight nothing between here and the Admiralty Group, except
      Greenwich Island, which is right athwart our course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I've heard that there is a passage into the lagoon. We might put
      in and spell there for a day or two; or, if we don't go inside, we could
      land anywhere on one of the lee-side islands, and get some young coconuts
      and a turtle or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any natives there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not any, as far as I know, though I've heard that there were a few there
      about twenty years ago. I expect they have either died out or emigrated to
      the northward. And if there are any there, and they don't want us to land,
      we can go on and leave them alone. We have plenty of provisions for a
      month, and will get more water than we want every night as long as we are
      in this cursed rainy belt. What we do want is wind. This breeze has no
      heart in it, and it looks like a calm before noon, or else it will haul
      round to the wrong quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His former surmise proved correct, for about midday the boat was becalmed
      on an oily, steamy sea under a fierce, brazen sun. This lasted for the
      remainder of the day, and then was followed by the usual squally night.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so for three days they sailed, making but little progress during the
      daytime, for the wind was light and baffling, but doing much better at
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the third day they sighted the northernmost islet of
      Pikirami lagoon, and stood by under its lee till daylight, little dreaming
      that those whose life-blood they would so eagerly have shed were sleeping
      calmly and peacefully in the native village fifteen miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the dawn came a sudden terrific downpour of rain, which lasted but
      for a few minutes, and both Chard and Hendry knew, from their own
      experience and from the appearance of the sky, that such outbursts were
      likely to continue for at least five or six days, with but brief intervals
      of cessation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might as well get ashore somewhere about here,&rdquo; said Hendry; &ldquo;this is
      the tail-end of the rainy season, and we can expect heavy rain and nasty
      squalls for a week at least. It's come on a bit earlier than I expected,
      and I think we'll be better ashore than boxing about at sea. Can you see
      the land to the south'ard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chard stood up and shielded his eyes from the still falling rain, but it
      was too thick for him to discern anything but the misty outline of the
      palm-fringed shore immediately near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll wait a bit till it's a little clearer, and then we'll run in over
      the reef just abreast of us,&rdquo; said Hendry; &ldquo;it's about high water, and as
      there is no surf we can cross over into the lagoon without any trouble,
      and pick out a camping-place somewhere on the inner beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They lowered the sail and mast, took out their oars, and waited till they
      could see clearly before them. A few minutes later they were pulling over
      the reef, on which there was no break, and in another half a mile they
      reached the shore of the most northern of the chain of islets encompassing
      the lagoon, and made the boat's painter fast to the serried roots of a
      pandanus palm growing at the edge of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they sought rest and shelter from the next downpour beneath the
      overhanging summits of some huge, creeper-clad boulders of coral rock,
      which lay piled together in the midst of the dense scrub, just beyond
      high-water mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bringing their arms and some provisions from the boat, they placed them on
      the dry sandy soil under one of the boulders, ate their breakfast, and
      then slept the sleep of men mentally and physically exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they awoke the rain had cleared off, and the sun was shining
      brightly. By the captain's watch it was a little past one o'clock, and
      after looking at the boat, which was high and dry on the beach; for the
      tide was now dead low, Chard suggested that they should make a brief
      examination of the islet, and get come young drinking and some fully-grown
      coconuts for use in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely we'll find some turtle eggs too,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;this and next
      month is the season. We are bound to get a turtle or two, anyway, if we
      watch to-night on the beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the camp, they picked up their loaded Winchesters and started
      off, walking along the beach on the inner side of the lagoon, and going in
      a northerly direction. The islet, although less than a mile and a half in
      circumference, was densely wooded and highly fertile, for in addition to
      the countless coco-palms which were laden with nuts in all stages of
      growth, and fringed the shore in an unbroken circle, there were great
      numbers of pandanus and jackfruit-trees growing further back. Here and
      there were to be seen traces of former inhabitants&mdash;depressions of an
      acre or so in extent, surrounded by high banks of soil, now thickly
      clothed with verdure, and which Chard, who had had a fair experience of
      the South Seas, knew were once plantations of <i>puraka</i>, the gigantic
      <i>taro</i> plant of the low-lying islands of the South and North Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a hundred years or more since any one worked at these <i>puraka</i>
      patches,&rdquo; he said to Hendry, as he sat upon the top of a bank and looked
      down. &ldquo;Look at the big trees growing all around us on the banks. There
      can't be natives living anywhere on the atoll now, so I don't think we
      need to keep a night watch as long as we stop here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But had Harvey Carr or any one of the native crew sat there on the bank,
      <i>they</i> would have quickly discovered many evidences of the spot
      having been visited very recently&mdash;the broken branch of a tree, a
      leaf basket lying flattened and rotting, and half covered by the sandy
      soil; a necklace of withered berries thrown aside by a native girl, and
      the crinkled and yellowed husks of some young coconuts which had been
      drunk not many weeks before by a fishing party.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the extreme northern point of the islet there stood a mound of coral
      slab, piled up by the action of the sea, and similar to the much larger
      one fifteen miles away at the other end of the lagoon. With some
      difficulty the two men succeeded in gaining the summit, and from there, at
      a height of fifty feet, they had a view of the greater portion of the
      atoll, and of some of the green chain of islands it enclosed. On no one of
      them could they discern signs of human occupancy, only long, long lines of
      cocos, with graceful slender boles leaning westward to the sea, and whose
      waving crowns of plumes cast their shadows upon the white sand beneath.
      From the beach itself to the barrier reef, a mile or two away, the water
      was a clear, pale green, unblemished in its purity except by an occasional
      patch of growing coral, which changed its colours from grey to purple and
      from purple to jetty black as a passing cloud for a brief space dimmed the
      lustre of the tropic sun. Beyond the line of green the great curving sweep
      of reef, with the snow-white, ever-breaking, murmuring surf churning and
      frothing upon it; and, just beyond that, the deep, deep blue of the
      Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no natives here, Louis,&rdquo; said Chard confidently, as his keen,
      black eyes traversed the scene before them; &ldquo;we can see a clear seven or
      eight miles along the beaches, and there's not a canoe to be seen on any
      one of them. We'll spell here for a day or two, or more, if the weather
      has not settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hendry nodded in his usual sullen manner. &ldquo;All right. We want a day to
      overhaul the boat thoroughly; the mainsail wants looking to as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us get back, and then we'll have a look over the next islet to
      this one before dark. We may come across some turtle tracks and get a nest
      of eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They descended the mound, and set out along the outer beach on their way
      back to the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had they remained but a few minutes longer they would have seen two canoes
      come into view about three miles to the southward, paddling leisurely
      towards the northernmost islet.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two canoes were manned by some of the crew of the <i>Motutapu</i>
      together with six natives of Pikirami; one was steered by Harvey, the
      other by Huka the Savage Islander; and as they paddled along within a few
      feet of each other the crews laughed and jested in the manner inherent to
      all the Malayo-Polynesians when intent on pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning Harvey, tiring of the inaction of the past three days, had
      eagerly assented to a proposal made by Huka that they should make a trip
      round the lagoon, and spend a day or two away from the village, fishing
      and shooting. Several young Pikirami natives at once launched two of their
      best canoes, and placed them at Harvey's and Atkins's service, and offered
      to go with the party and do all the paddling, cooking, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Nena the head-man, a little wizen-faced but kindly-eyed old
      fellow, whose body was so deeply tatooed in broad vertical bands that
      scarcely a strip of brown skin could be seen&mdash;&ldquo;ay, ye must take my
      young men; for are ye not our guests, ye, and the brown sailor men as
      well? and they shall tend on ye all. That is our custom to strangers who
      have come to us as friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Preparations were at once made for a start, and Harvey went to tell Tessa,
      whom he found in the house allotted to her, listening to Atkins, who was
      planning some improvements in the interior so as to add to her comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could go with you, Harvey,&rdquo; said Tessa with a bright smile; &ldquo;it
      would be like the old days in Ponapé, with you and my brothers. How long
      will you be away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps two days. Will you come, Atkins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me! The less salt water I see and the less rain-water I feel for
      another week the better I'll like it. Besides, I'm going to do a bit of
      carpentering work for Miss Remington. We may have to hang out here for a
      month before that Dutch schooner comes along, and I'm just going to set to
      work and make Miss Remington comfy. And if you had any sense, Harvey,
      you'd stay under shelter instead of trying to get another dose of shakes
      by going out and fooling around in a canoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey laughed. &ldquo;There's no more fever for me, Atkins. I'm clear of it.
      That little boat trip of ours has knocked it clean out of my bones, and if
      you don't believe me, I'm willing to prove it by getting to the top of
      that coconut-tree outside there in ten seconds' quicker time than you can
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat voyage had certainly done him good, and although he had by no
      means thoroughly recovered his strength, his cheeks had lost their yellow,
      haggard look, and his eyes were bright with returning health. Atkins, who
      knew that Tessa was to become his wife, looked first at him and then at
      her with sly humour twinkling in his honest grey eyes. Then he took his
      pipe out of his pocket and put it in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll come back by and by. Two is company, and three is none. The
      sooner <i>I</i> go, the better you'll like it, and the sooner <i>you</i>
      go, Harvey, the sooner I can get to work;&rdquo; and so saying he walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tessa's dark eyes danced with fun as she walked backwards from Harvey, and
      leaning against the thatched side of the house, put her finger to her
      lips. &ldquo;What a <i>beautiful</i> sensible man he is, isn't he, Harvey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a man after my own heart, Tessa,&rdquo; and then Maoni, who sat smoking a
      cigarette in a corner of the room, discreetly turned her back as certain
      sibilant sounds were frequently repeated for a minute or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harvey, you sinner,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I don't like you a bit. Really and
      truly I don't.... Now,<i> now</i>, no more.... Maoni can hear you, I'm
      sure. The <i>idea</i> of your going away for two days&mdash;two whole days&mdash;and
      marching calmly up to me and telling me of it in such a rude,
      matter-of-fact manner. You <i>are</i> unkind.... <i>Don't</i>.... I don't
      like you, Harvey... I'll tell father that you went away and left me for
      two whole days&mdash;to go fishing and pig-shooting, and poor Mr. Atkins
      had to look after me, and... oh, Harvey, Harvey, isn't it lovely! Father
      will be so glad, and so will Carmela and Jack, and Librada and Ned. Harvey
      dear, I do hope your sisters will like me. Perhaps they will think I am
      only a native girl.... Oh, <i>do</i> be careful, I can see Maoni's back
      shaking. She <i>knows</i> you're kissing me, I'm sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't care if she does; don't care if she sees me kissing you, like this,
      and this, <i>and</i> this; don't care if Atkins sees us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her low, happy laugh sounded like the trill of a bird. &ldquo;Harvey dear, do
      you remember the day when we went to Róan Kiti in Ponapé&mdash;when you
      were sailing the <i>Belle Brandon</i> for father?&rdquo;

    <p>
      Harvey didn't remember, but, like a sensible lover, said he did, and
      emphasised his remembrance in a proper manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, listen... Oh, you horrid fellow, why do you look at me as if I
      were a baby! Now, I shan't tell you anything at all.... There, don't
      pretend to be sorry, for you know... oh, Harvey dear, I <i>must</i> tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a good boy, a good would-be-climbing-a-coconut-tree youth, who
      wanted to show off before poor Atkins who told me just now that you were
      'the whitest man in the South Seas.' He did really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Atkins is 'an excellent good man,' and you are the sweetest and most
      beautiful girl in <i>all</i> the wide, wide Pacific. Come, tell me what it
      is that you <i>must</i> tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you if you don't kiss me any more. Maoni's eyes can see round
      her shoulders, I believe. I <i>do wish</i> she wasn't here.... Well, that
      day when you and I were climbing up the mountain-path you let a branch
      swing back&mdash;you careless thing&mdash;and it hit me in the face and
      hurt me terribly, and you took me up in your arms and kissed me. Oh,
      Harvey, don't you remember? Kissed me, just because I was crying like a
      baby. Harvey dear, I was only fourteen then, but I loved you then&mdash;that
      was the real, <i>very</i> beginning of it all, I think. And then I went
      away to school to San Francisco, and <i>you</i> went away&mdash;and I
      suppose you never thought one little bit about me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I did, Tess&rdquo; (here was a silent but well-employed interlude); &ldquo;I
      often thought of you, dear, but not as a lover thinks. For in those days
      you were to me only a sweet child (if Maoni wasn't here I'd pick you up
      and nurse you), a sweet, sweet little comrade whose dear, soft eyes used
      to smile into mine whenever I stepped into your father's house, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Harvey, Harvey! I have never, never forgotten you. <i>There!</i> and
      <i>there!</i> and <i>there!</i> I don't care if Maoni, or any one, or all
      the world sees me,&rdquo; and she flung her soft arms round his neck and kissed
      him again and again in the sheer abandonment of her innocent happiness.
      &ldquo;But you really <i>love</i> me now, Harvey, don't you? And oh, Harvey
      dear, where shall we live? And your sisters... if they don't like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey stroked her soft hair, and pressed his lips to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won't <i>like</i> you, Tess. They'll just love you&mdash;and they'll
      make me jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again her happy laugh trilled out. &ldquo;How lovely!... Harvey dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Tess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to tell you something&mdash;something that only mother knows,
      something about me&mdash;and a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey looked smilingly into her deep, tender eyes, half-suffused with
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead, indeed! You rough, rude sailor! Any one would think I was a man
      by the way you speak to me... But, Harvey dear, listen... there was a man
      who wanted to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harvey was all attention at once. &ldquo;Sit down here, little woman, and tell
      me who the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! Don't swear, or I won't tell you anything, not <i>anything at all</i>,
      about it.... Harvey dear, why do you want to go away fishing? Stay here,
      and help poor Mr. Atkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the man, Tess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really, really going away for two whole days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, sweet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harvey dear, I'll tell you all about it. You won't be angry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All depends. Who was the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His laughing eyes belied his assumed sternness of visage, for in her eyes
      there shone a light so serenely pure that he knew he had naught to dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very, <i>very</i> nice man, sir. Now try and guess who it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Schuler, the fat German trader at Yap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you wretch, Harvey! He's been married three times, and has dozens and
      dozens of all sorts of coloured children.... Now there! Guess again or
      I'll twist this side of your moustache until I make you cry.... Harvey
      dear, who was the girl whose photograph was over your bunk in father's
      schooner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget. Most likely it was my sister Kate,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you, Mr. Harvey Carr. But I'll find out all about <i>you</i>
      by and by. You'll have to just tell me <i>everything</i>. Now guess
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain of the <i>Lafayette</i>. He asked each of your sisters to
      marry him, I know, and I suppose you followed in turn as soon as you began
      to wear long dresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That horrible man! We all hated him. No, indeed, it was somebody better
      than the captain of a whaler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be so superior, Tess. Your brother Ned hopes to be skipper of a
      whaler some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Ned is very good-looking, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was old Ayton before he lost his teeth, and one eye, and began 'ter
      chaw terbacker' and drink Bourbon by the gallon.... Beauty is only skin
      deep, my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you, you&mdash;I don't know what to call you, but I do know that I
      have a round turn of your moustache in my hand, and could make you go on
      your knees if I liked. Now guess again; you're getting 'warmer,' because
      it&mdash;<i>he</i> I mean&mdash;is a captain. Quick, and don't struggle
      so. I mean to keep you here just as long as I please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, old Freeman. He's a captain, or was one about a hundred years
      ago, when he was much younger than he is now.&rdquo; (Freeman was a nonogenerian
      settler on Ponapé and a neighbour of Tessa's father.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be so silly! I've a great mind not to tell you at all, but as you
      haven't whimpered when I pulled your moustache I <i>shall</i> tell you&mdash;it&mdash;he,
      I mean&mdash;was Captain Reade, of the United States ship <i>Narrangansett</i>.
      Now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then all her raillery vanished in a moment. &ldquo;He was a great friend of
      father's, you know, Harvey; and first he asked father, and father said I
      was too young, and then when I was leaving school in San Francisco to come
      home he wrote to me and asked me if he could come and see me. And he did
      come, and asked me to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really didn't care for him, Tessa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. How could I? Harvey, I never, never thought about anybody in
      the world but you,&rdquo; and she looked into his face with swimming eyes as he
      pressed his lips to hers. &ldquo;There, I'll let you go now, dear. I can hear
      Huka and the others coming for you. But Harvey dear, don't stay away for
      two whole days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      An hour after leaving the village the canoes turned aside into a small
      narrow bay on one of the larger islands. The water was of great depth,
      from sixty to seventy fathoms, though the bay itself was in no part wider
      than a hundred yards. A solid wall of coral enclosed it on three sides,
      rising sheer up from the deep blue, and its surface was now bared and
      drying fast under the rays of the sun, for the rain had cleared off, and
      the sky was a vault of unflecked blue once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natives had told Harvey and Roka that this bay was a spot famed as the
      haunt of a huge species of rock-cod called <i>pura</i>, some of which,
      they said, &ldquo;took two strong men to lift,&rdquo; and they were greatly pleased
      when they found that both the white man and Roka knew the <i>pura</i>
      well, and had eagerly assented to Harvey's proposition that they should
      spend an hour or two in the place, and try and get one or two of the
      gigantic fish; as they had the necessary tackle&mdash;thick, six-plaited
      lines of coir fibre, with heavy wooden hooks such as are used for
      shark-fishing by the natives of the equatorial and north-west islands of
      the Pacific.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Had Harvey and his companions been ten minutes later in turning aside to
      enter the bay they would have been seen by Chard and Hendry ere they
      descended the coral mound at the north end of the lagoon, and much of this
      tale would not have been told. For had the destroyers of poor Oliver and
      his crew discovered the canoes they probably would at once have launched
      their boat again, and have put to sea, or at least prepared themselves for
      an attack. But great events so often come of small things.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly an hour Harvey, Roka, and Huka fished for <i>pura</i> from the
      coral ledges, but without success. They had baited their hooks with
      flying-fish, as was the practice of the Pikirami people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Roka presently to Harvey, &ldquo;never have I had good luck with
      flying-fish when fishing for <i>pura</i> in mine own land of Manhiki. 'Tis
      a <i>feke</i>{*} that the pura loveth.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Octopus.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Roka, <i>feke</i> is a good bait for the <i>pura</i> and all those
      great fish which live deep down in their <i>fale amu</i>&rdquo; (houses of
      coral). &ldquo;Let us seek for one on the outer reef. Then we shall return here.
      It is in my heart to show these our good friends of Pikirami that there is
      one white man who can catch a <i>pura</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roka showed his white teeth in an approving smile. &ldquo;Thou art a clever
      white man, and can do all those things that we brown men can do. Malua
      hath told me that there is no one like thee in all the world for skill in
      fishing and many things. Let us go seek <i>feke</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of their party&mdash;the men from the <i>Motutapu</i> and the
      Pikirami people&mdash;were busily employed in preparations for cooking,
      some making ready an oven of red-hot stones, others putting up fish and
      chickens in leaf wrappers, and Malua and two Pikirami youths of his own
      age were husking numbers of young drinking-nuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Telling his native friends that he would return in an hour or two, or as
      soon as he had caught some <i>feke</i>. Harvey set off, accompanied by
      Roka and Huka, the latter carrying a heavy turtle-spear, about five feet
      in length from the tip of its wide arrow-headed point to the end of the
      pole of ironwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the eastward, they struck into the cool shade of the narrow
      strip of forest which clothed the island from the inner lagoon beach to
      the outer or weather side, and Harvey at once began to search among the
      small pools on the reef for an octopus, Huka with Roka going on ahead with
      his turtle-spear. In the course of a quarter of an hour they were out of
      sight of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time Harvey, armed with a light wooden fish-spear, carefully
      examined the shallow pools as he walked along over the reef, and after he
      had progressed about a mile he at last saw one of the hideous creatures he
      sought lying on the white sandy bottom of a circular hole in the reef, its
      green malevolent eyes looking upward at the intruder. In an instant he
      thrust the spear through its horrible marbled head, and drew it out upon
      the rocks, where he proceeded to kill it, a task which took him longer
      than he anticipated; then carrying it back to the shore, he threw the
      still quivering monster upon a prominent rock and set out again in search
      of another, intending to follow his native comrades, who were in hopes of
      striking a turtle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he tramped over the reef, crushing the living, many-coloured coral
      under his booted feet, his eyes were arrested by some objects lying on the
      bottom of a deep pool. He bent down and looked carefully&mdash;five
      magnificent orange cowries were clinging closely together upon a large
      white and sea-worn slab of dead coral.
    </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation ot pleasure escaped from him as he saw the great size and
      rich colouring of these rare and beautiful shells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely present for Tessa!&rdquo; he thought; and taking off his shirt he
      dived into the clear water and brought them up one by one. Then with
      almost boyish delight he placed them beside him on the reef, and looked at
      them admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you beauties!&rdquo; he said, passing his hand over their glossy backs; &ldquo;how
      delighted Tessa will be! No one else has ever had the luck to find five
      such shells together. I'm a <i>tagata manuia lava</i>,{*} as Malua says.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A man with extraordinary good luck.
</pre>
    <p>
      He picked the shells up carefully, put them into his wide-brimmed leaf
      hat, which he then tied up in his shirt, and taking his spear again made
      towards the shore, too pleased at his good fortune to trouble any further
      about another <i>feke</i> and only anxious to let Roka and Huka see his
      prizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way to the shore he paused and looked along the curving line of beach
      to see if either of them were in sight; then from behind a vine-covered
      boulder not fifty yards away a rifle cracked, and he fell forward on his
      face without a cry.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon after they had left Harvey the Manhikian and Huka parted, each
      preferring to take his own way, Roka laughingly telling his comrade that
      although he, Roka, had no spear, he would bring back a turtle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my land of Manihiki we trouble not about spears. We dive after the
      turtle and drag them ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou boaster,&rdquo; replied the Savage Islander good-naturedly, as he stepped
      briskly down the hard, white sand towards the water, his sturdy,
      reddish-brown body naked to the waist, and his brawny right arm twirling
      the heavy turtle-spear about his head as if it were a bamboo wand. &ldquo;I go
      into the lagoon, whither goest thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roka pointed ahead. &ldquo;Along the beach towards the islet with the high
      trees. May we both be lucky in our fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he was out of sight and hearing of his shipmate, for the
      beach took a sudden curve round a low, densely-verdured point, on the
      other side of which it ran in an almost straight line for a mile. Suddenly
      he paused and shaded his eyes with his hand as he caught sight of a dark
      object lying on the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis a boat,&rdquo; he muttered, and in another moment he was speeding towards
      it. When within a few hundred yards he stopped and then crouched upon his
      hands and knees, his dark eyes gleaming with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the captain's boat,&rdquo; he said to himself, as lying flat upon his
      stomach he dragged himself over the sand into the shelter of the low
      thicket scrub which fringed the bank at high-water mark. Once there, he
      stood up, and watched carefully. Then stripping off his clothes and
      throwing them aside, he sped swiftly along an old native path, which ran
      parallel to the beach, till he was abreast of the boat. Then he crouched
      down again and listened. No sound broke the silence except the call of the
      sea-birds and the drone of the surf upon the reef.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited patiently, his keen eyes searching and his quick ear listening;
      then creeping softly along on his hands and knees again, he examined the
      sandy soil. In a few minutes his search was rewarded, for he came across
      the footmarks of Chard and the captain, leading to the vine-covered
      boulders under the shelter of which they had made their camp. Following
      these up, he was soon at the place itself, and examining the various
      articles lying upon the ground&mdash;provisions, clothing, the roll of
      charts, sextant. Leaning against the rocky wall was a Snider carbine. He
      seized it quickly, opened the breach, and saw that it was loaded; then he
      made a hurried search for more cartridges, and found nearly a dozen tied
      up in a handkerchief with about fifty Winchesters. These latter he quickly
      buried in the sand, and then with his eyes alight with the joy of savage
      expectancy of revenge, he again sought and found the tracks of the two
      men, which led in the very direction from which he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a man like Roka there was no difficulty in following the line which
      Hendry and the supercargo had taken; their footsteps showed deep in the
      soft, sandy soil, rendered the more impressionable by the heavy downfall
      of rain a few hours before. And even had they left no traces underfoot of
      their progress, the countless broken branches and vines which they had
      pushed or torn aside on their way through the forest were a sure guide to
      one of Nature's children, whose pursuit was quickened by his desire for
      vengeance upon the murderers of his brother and his shipmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pushing his way through a dense strip of the tough, thorny scrub called <i>ngiia</i>,
      he suddenly emerged into the open once more&mdash;on the weather side of
      the island. First his eye ran along the sand to discover which way the
      footsteps trended; they led southwards towards a low, rugged boulder whose
      sides and summit were thickly clothed with a thick, fleshy-leaved creeper.
      Beyond that lay the bare expanse of reef, along which he saw Harvey Carr
      was walking towards the shore, unconscious of danger. And right in his
      line of vision he saw Chard, who, kneeling amid the foliage of the
      boulder, was covering Harvey with his rifle; in another instant the
      supercargo had fired, Roka dropped on one knee and raised his Snider
      carbine, just as Sam Chard turned to Hendry with a smile upon his
      handsome, evil face, and waved his hand mockingly towards the prone figure
      of Harvey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's one more to the good, Louis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, when Roka's
      carbine rang out, and the supercargo spun round, staggering, and then fell
      upon his hands and knees, with the blood gushing in torrents from his
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hendry, taking no heed of anything but his own safety, dashed into the
      undergrowth and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running past Chard, rifle in hand, the Manhikian launched a curse at the
      groaning man, who heard him not in his agony. Leaping from pool to pool
      over the rough, jagged coral, which cut and tore his feet and legs, the
      seaman sprang to Harvey's aid, and a hoarse sob of joy burst from him when
      he saw that he was not dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My thigh is broken, Roka. Carry me to the shore quickly, and then haste,
      haste, good Roka, and warn the others. These men of Pikirami are traitors.
      Haste thee, dear friend, if ye be a good man and true, and help to save
      the woman who is dear to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tearing off the sleeves of Harvey's shirt, Roka, as he answered, bound
      them tightly over the wound to stay the flow of blood. &ldquo;Nay, master, 'tis
      not the men of Pikirami. 'Tis the captain and the <i>tuhi tuhi</i>{*} who
      have done this to thee. Nay, question me no more... so, gently, let me
      lift thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised Harvey up in his mighty arms as if he were a child, his right
      hand still grasping the Snider carbine, and carried him carefully to the
      beach. There he laid him down for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay not here with me, Roka of Manhiki,&rdquo; said Harvey, trying hard to
      speak calmly, though he was suffering the greatest agony from his wound&mdash;&ldquo;stay
      not here, but run, run quickly, so that there may be no more murder done.
      Leave me here.... Tell the <i>sua alii</i>{**} to get the people together
      and hunt and slay those two men. Give them no mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I.e., one who writes&mdash;a supercargo or clerk.

     ** The mate, chief officer&mdash;one next in command to a
     captain.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No mercy shall they have,&rdquo; said the Manhikian grimly; &ldquo;so rest thee
      content for a little while.... <i>Aue!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet, carbine in hand, for from out the thickset jungle
      there emerged a thing of horror to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chard, leaning upon his Winchester, was staggering down to the beach, with
      his lower jaw shot away. He came blindly on towards the man he had sought
      to murder, gasping and groaning. Then he saw Roka, dropped his Winchester,
      threw up his hands, and tried to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roka walked up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis better for thee to die quickly,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supercargo swayed to and fro, and mutely held out both hands to Harvey
      as if imploring help or forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roka drew back, and planted his left foot firmly in the sand, as he placed
      the muzzle of his carbine against Chard's breast, and Chard, grasping the
      barrel in his left hand to steady himself, bent his dreadful face upon his
      chest.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As the loud report reverberated through the leafy forest aisles there came
      the sound of rushing feet, and Malua and the rest of the crew of the
      Motutapu, together with the six Pikirami natives, burst through the
      undergrowth, and gazed in wonder at the scene before them&mdash;Harvey
      lying on the sand, Roka with his still-smoking rifle in his hand, standing
      over the dead body of Chard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too weak from loss of blood to answer Malua's weeping inquiries, Harvey
      yet managed to smile at him, and indicate Roka by a wave of his hand. Then
      the Manhikian spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No time is there now to tell ye all. Run back, some of ye, to the <i>sua
      alii</i> Atkins, and tell him that I have killed the man Chard, but that
      the captain hath escaped. Get thee each a rifle and follow him. He hath
      fled towards his boat, which lieth on the little island with the high
      trees. Follow, follow quickly, lest he drag the boat into the water and
      sail away. Slay him. Let his blood run out. And tell the <i>sua alii</i>
      Atkins and the white girl that Harfi hath been sorely hurt, but is well,
      and will not die, for it is but a broken bone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five or six men darted off, while the rest, under Roka's directions,
      quickly made a litter for Harvey, and placed him upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou in pain, master?&rdquo; asked the giant Manhikian tenderly, as the
      bearers lifted the wounded man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but let me smoke so that the pain may go. And one of ye go to where I
      fell on the reef and bring me the five pule,{*} lest when the tide cometh
      in they be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Cowries.

    <p>
      Roka himself ran off, picked up the hat and shells and brought them back;
      then he gave the word to march.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way through the forest they were met by Atkins and Tessa, who were
      accompanied by the entire population of the village, except those of the
      young men who had set off in pursuit of Hendry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm all right, Tessa,&rdquo; said Harvey; &ldquo;it's only a broken bone. Atkins, old
      man, don't look so worried. You can set it easily enough. Good man, you've
      brought some rum, I see, and 'I willna say no,' as poor Morrison used to
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atkins, whose hand was shaking with excitement, for he thought that
      perhaps Harvey was mortally wounded and was only assuming cheerfulness,
      gave him a stiff tot of rum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's luck to you, Atkins. Tessa dear, don't cry. Atkins will fix me up
      in a brace of shakes as soon as we get to the village. And look here,
      Tess. See what I found upon the reef.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Long before sunset Harvey was sleeping quietly in the head-man's house,
      with Tessa and Maoni watching beside him. Atkins had carefully set the
      broken limb with broad splints of coconut-spathe; and, proud and satisfied
      with his work, was pacing to and fro outside the house, smoking his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Latour and Malua appeared, and the Frenchman beckoned to the
      second mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, steward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huka has just come back, sir. He wants to see you. The captain is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for that. Where did they get him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huka will tell you, sir. Here he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Savage Islander stepped forward, and raised his hand in salute, with a
      smile of pride upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I been kill him,&rdquo; he said in his broken English; &ldquo;I was come along back
      to meet Mr. Harvey, when I hear the guns. And then I see the captain come,
      running quick. He have Winchester in his hand, and when he see me he stop.
      He fire two, three times at me. Then I run up to him, and I drive my
      turtle spear through him, and he fall down and I put my foot on his mouth,
      and he die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Atkins slapped him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Good man you, Huka! Stay here a
      moment, and I'll bring you a big drink of rum. Then we must go and bury
      both the swine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Three weeks later the <i>Sikiana</i> sailed into the lagoon, and the &ldquo;good
      little Dutch skipper,&rdquo; of whom Harvey had spoken, had him brought on board
      and placed in his bunk for the voyage to Ponapé.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My tear Mees Tessa,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr. Carr haf dold me dat your fader vill
      gif me five hundred dollar ven ve get to Ponapé. If der <i>Sikiana</i> vas
      mein own ship I vould dake you und Mr. Carr and der second mate und all
      your natives to Ponapé for nodings; for your fader vas a good man to me,
      und Harvey Carr vas a good man to me ven I sailed mit him in the <i>Belle
      Brandon</i>. But you must invide old Westphalen to the wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed we shall, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me too, miss?&rdquo; asked Atkins, with a sly twinkle in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you too, of course, dear, dear Atkins, so good, brave, and true.
      There, look, Harvey, I am going to kiss Mr. Atkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you both, miss,&rdquo; said the mate huskily.
